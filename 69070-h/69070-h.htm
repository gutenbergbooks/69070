<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> manifold powers of circumstance were in
conspiracy against Ned Cornet this late August
afternoon. No detail was important in itself. It
had been drizzling slowly and mournfully, but
drizzle is not uncommon in Seattle. Ned Cornet
had been passing the time pleasantly in the Totem
Club, on Fourth Street, doing nothing in particular,
nothing exceedingly bad or good or even unusually
diverting; but such was quite a customary
practice with him. Finally, Cornet’s special
friend, Rodney Coburn, had just returned from one
of his hundred sojourns in far places,—this time
from an especially attractive salmon stream in
Canada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two young men had met in Coburn’s room
at the Totem Club, and the steward had gone
thither with tall glasses and ice. Coburn had not
returned empty-handed from Canada. Besides
pleasant memories of singing reels and throbbing
rods and of salmon that raced like wild sea horses
down the riffles, he had brought that which was
much less healthful,—various dark bottles of time-honored
liquors. Partly in celebration of his return,
and partly because of the superior quality of
the goods that had accompanied him, his friend Ned
raised his afternoon limit from two powerful pre-dinner
cocktails to no less than four richly amber
whiskies-and-sodas. Thus their meeting was auspicious,
and on leaving the club, about seven, it
came about that Ned Cornet met the rain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not enough to bother him. He didn’t
even think about it. It was only a lazy, smoky
drizzle that deepened the shadows of falling twilight
and blurred the lights in the street. Ned
Cornet had a fire within that more or less occupied
his thoughts. He didn’t notice the rain, and he
quite failed to observe the quick pulsation of the
powerful engine in his roadster that might otherwise
have warned him that he had long since passed
the absolute limit that tolerant traffic officers could
permit in the way of speed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cornet was not really drunk. His stomach was
fortified, by some years of experience, against an
amount somewhere in the region of a half-pint of
the most powerful spirits,—sufficient poison to kill
stone dead a good percentage of the lower animals.
Being a higher animal Ned held his liquor surprisingly
well. He was somewhat exhilarated, faintly
flushed; his eyes had a sparkle as of broken glass,
and he felt distinctly warm and friendly toward all
the hurrying thousands on the street, but his motor
centers were not in the least impaired. Under
stress, and by inhaling sharply, he could deceive his
own mother into thinking that he had not had a
drink. Nevertheless a pleasant recklessness was
upon him, and he couldn’t take the trouble to observe
such stupid things as traffic laws and rain-wet
pavements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it came about that this exhilaration was not
to endure long. In a space of time so short that it
resembled some half-glimpsed incident in a dream,
Ned found himself, still at his wheel, the car crosswise
in the street and the front wheels almost touching
the curb, a terrible and ghastly sobriety upon
him. Something had happened. He had gone
into a perilous skid at the corner of Fourth and
Madison, the car had slid sickeningly out of his
control, and at the wrong instant a dark shape, all
too plainly another automobile, had lurched out of
the murk of the rain. There had been no sense of
violent shock. All things had slid easily, the sound
at his fender was slow and gentle, and people, in
the fading light, had slow, peculiar expressions on
their faces. Then a great fear, like a sharp point,
pricked him and he sprang from his seat in one
powerful leap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned Cornet had had automobiles at his command
long before it was safe for him to have his hands on
them. When cold sober he drove rather too fast,
none too carefully, but had an almost incredible
mastery over his car. He knew how to pick his
wheel tracks over bumpy roads, and he knew the
exact curve that a car could take with safety in
rounding a corner. Even now, in the crisis that
had just been, he had handled his car like the veteran
he was. The wonder was not that he had hit
the other car, but rather, considering the speed with
which he had come, that it should continue to remain
before his sight, but little damaged, instead of being
shattered into kindling and dust. His instincts
had responded rather well. It was a somewhat
significant thing, to waken hope in the breast of an
otherwise despairing father, that in that stress and
terror he had kept his head, he had handled his
brakes and wheel in the only way that would be of
any possible good, and almost by miracle had
avoided a smashing crash that could have easily
killed him and every occupant in the colliding car.
Nevertheless it was not yet time to receive congratulations
from spectators. There had been serious
consequences enough. He was suddenly face
to face with the fact that in his haste to get home
for dinner he had very likely obliterated a human
life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a curious, huddled heap on the dim
pavement, just beyond the small car he had struck.
It was a girl; she lay very still, and the face half
covered by the arm seemed very white and lifeless.
And blasted by a terror such as was never known in
all his wasted years, Ned leaped, raced, and fell to
his knees at her side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed to him that the soft noise of the crash
was not yet dead in the air. It was as if he had
made the intervening distance in one leap. In that
same little second his brain encompassed limitless
areas,—terror, remorse, certain vivid vistas of his
past life, the whiteness of the eyelids and the limpness
of the little arms, and the startled faces of the
spectators who were hurrying toward him. His
mental mechanism, dulled before by drink, was
keyed to such a degree that the full scope of the
accident went home to him in an instant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The car he had struck was one of the thousands
of “jitneys” of which he had so often spoken with
contempt. The girl was a shopgirl or factory
worker, on her way home. Shaken with horror, but
still swift and strong from the stimulus of the crisis,
he lifted her head and shoulders in his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a dark second in the life of this care-free,
self-indulgent son of wealth as he stared into the
white, blank, thin face before him. He was closer
to the Darkness that men know as Death than he
had ever been before,—so close that some of its
shadow went into his own eyes, and made them
look like odd black holes in his white skin, quite
different from the vivid orbs that Rodney Coburn
had seen over the tall glasses an hour before. For
once, Ned Cornet was face to face with stern
reality. And he waited, stricken with despair, for
that face to give some sign of life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was all the matter of a second. The people
who had seen the accident and the remaining passengers
of the “jitney” had not yet reached his
side. But for all that, the little instant of waiting
contained more of the stuff of life than all the rest
of Ned Cornet’s time on earth. Then the girl
smiled in his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not hurt,” he heard her say, seemingly in
answer to some senseless query of his. She shook
her head at the same time, and she smiled as she did
it. “I know what I’m saying,” she went on. “I’m
not hurt—one—bit!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A great elation and enthusiasm went over the little
crowd that was gathering around her. There
could be no doubt but that she told the truth. Her
voice had the full ring of one whose nerves are absolutely
unimpaired. Evidently she had received but
the slightest blow from one of the cars when its
momentum was all but spent. And now, with the
aid of a dozen outstretching hands, she was on her
feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little drama, as if hurled in an instant from
the void, was already done. Tragedy had been
averted; it was merely one of the thousands of unimportant
smash-ups that occur in a great city
every year. Some of the spectators were already
moving on. In just a moment, before half a dozen
more words could be said, other cars were swinging
by, and a policeman was on the scene asking questions
and jotting down license numbers. Just for
a moment he paused at Ned’s elbow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your name and address, please?” he asked
coldly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned whirled, turning his eyes from the girl’s face
for the first time. “Ned Cornet,” he answered.
And he gave his father’s address on Queen Anne
Hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Show up before Judge Rossman in the morning,”
he ordered. “The jitney there will send
their bills to you. I’d advise you to pay ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll pay ’em,” Ned agreed. “I’ll throw in an
extra twenty to pay for their loss of time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This young lady says she ain’t hurt,” the policeman
went on. “It certainly is no credit to you
that she ain’t. There is plenty of witnesses here if
she wants to make a suit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll give this young lady complete satisfaction,”
Ned promised. He turned to her in easy friendliness,
a queer little crooked smile, winning and astonishingly
juvenile, appearing at his mouth.
“Now let’s get in my car. I’ll take you home—and
we can talk this over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They pushed together through the little circle of
the curious, he helped her courteously into the big,
easy seat of his roadster, and in a moment they were
threading their way through the early evening
traffic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good Lord,” the man breathed. “I wouldn’t
have blamed that mob if they had lynched me.
Where do we go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She directed him out Madison, into a district of
humble, modest, but respectable residences. “It’s
lucky you came along—I don’t often get a ride
clear to my door.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lucky! I want to say if it wasn’t for all the
luck in the world you’d be going to the hospital instead.
I’m taking all the blame for that smash
back there—I got off mighty lucky. Now let’s
settle about the dress—and a few other things.
First—you’re sure you’re not hurt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a little surprised at the gay, girlish smile
about her lips. “Not a particle. It would be nice
if I could go to the hospital two weeks or so, just to
rest—but I haven’t the conscience to do it. I’m
not even scratched—just pushed over in the street.
And I’m afraid I can’t even charge you for the
dress. I’ve always had too much conscience, Mr.
Cornet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I’m going to pay——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The dress cost only about twenty dollars—at
a sale. And it doesn’t seem to be even damaged.
Of course it will have to be cleaned. To save you
the embarrassment I see growing in your face, I’ll
gladly send the bill to you if you like——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the bright street light he looked up, studying
her face. He had never really observed it before.
Before he had watched it for a sign of life that was
only the antithesis of death, but now he found himself
regarding it from another viewpoint. Her
slender, pretty face was wholly in keeping with her
humor, her honesty, her instinctive good manners.
If she were a factory worker, hard toil had not in
the least coarsened or hardened her. Her skin had
a healthy freshness, pink like the marvelous pink of
certain spring wild flowers, and she had delicate
girlish features that wholly suited his appraising
eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was one of those girls who have worlds of
hair to spend lavishly in setting off piquant faces.
It must have been dark brown; at least it looked so
in the street light. Below was a clear, girlish brow,
with never a line except the friendly ones of companionship
and humor. Her eyes seemed to be
deeply blue, good-natured, childishly happy, amazingly
clear and luminous, a perfect index to her
mood. Now they were smiling, partly with delight
in the ride and in the luxury of the car, partly from
the sheer joy of the adventure. Ned rather wished
that the light was better. He’d like to have given
them further study.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had a pretty nose, and full, almost sensuous
lips that curled easily and softly as she smiled.
Then there was a delectable glimpse of the little
hollow of a slender throat, at the collar of her dress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned found himself staring, and he didn’t know
just why. He was no stranger to women’s beauty;
some degree of it was the rule rather than the exception
in the circle in which he moved; but some
way this before him now was beauty of a different
kind. It was warm, and it went down inside of him
and touched some particular mood and fancy that
had never manifested itself before. He had seen
such beauty, now and again, in children—young
girls with the freshness of a spring flower, just
emerging into the bloom of first womanhood, and
not yet old enough for him to meet in a social way—but
it had never occurred to him that it could
linger past the “flapper” age. This girl in his car
was in her early twenties—over, rather than under—of
medium height, with the slender strength of an
expert swimmer, yet her beauty was that of a child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He couldn’t tell, at first, in just what her beauty
lay. Other girls had fresh skins, bright eyes, smiling
lips and masses of dark, lustrous hair,—and
some of them even had the simplicity of good manners.
Ned had a quick, sure mind, and for a moment
he mused over his wheel as he tried to puzzle
it out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In all probability it lay in the soft, girlish lines
about her lips and eyes. Curiously there was not
the slightest <span class='it'>hardness</span> about them. Some way, this
girl had missed a certain hardening process that
most of his own girl friends had undergone; the life
of the twentieth century, in a city of more than
three hundred thousand, had left her unscathed.
There were only tenderness and girlish sweetness in
the lines, not sophistication, not self-love, not recklessness
or selfishness that he had some way come
to expect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But soon after this Ned Cornet caught himself
with a whispered oath. He was positively maudlin!
The excitement, the near approach to tragedy, the
influence of the liquor manifesting itself once more
in his veins were making him stare and think like a
silly fool. The girl was a particularly attractive
shopgirl or factory worker, strong and athletic for
all her appealing slenderness, doubtless pretty
enough to waken considerable interest in certain of
his friends who went in for that sort of thing, but
he, Ned Cornet, had other interests. The gaze he
bent upon her was suddenly indifferent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were almost at their destination now, and
he did not see the sudden decline of her mood in response
to his dying interest. Sensitive as a flower
to sunlight, she realized in a moment that a barrier
of caste had dropped down between them. She was
silent the rest of the way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you mind telling me what you do—in
the way of work, I mean?” he asked her, at her
door. “My father has a business that employs
many girls. There might be a chance——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can do almost anything with a needle, thank
you,” she told him with perfect frankness. “Fitting,
hemstitching, embroidery—I could name a
dozen other things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We employ dozens of seamstresses and fitters.
I suppose I can reach you here—after work-hours.
I’ll keep you in mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An instant later he had bidden her good night
and driven away, little dreaming that, through the
glass pane of the door, her lustrous blue eyes had
followed the red spark that was his tail-light till it
disappeared in the deepening gloom.</p>

<div><h1>II</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Ned Cornet</span> kept well within the speed laws on
his way back to his father’s beautiful home on
Queen Anne Hill. He was none too well pleased
with himself, and his thoughts were busy. There
would be some sort of a scene with Godfrey Cornet,
the gray man whose self-amassed wealth would
ultimately settle for the damages to the “jitney”
and the affront to the municipality,—perhaps only
a frown, a moment’s coldness about the lips, but a
scene nevertheless. He looked forward to it with
great displeasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a curious thing that lately he had begun
to feel vague embarrassment and discomfiture in
his father’s presence. He had been finding it a
comfort to avoid him, to go to his club on the evenings
his father spent at home, and especially to shun
intimate conversation with him. Ned didn’t know
just why this was true; perhaps he had never
paused to think about it before. He simply felt
more at ease away from his father, more free to go
his own way. Some way, the very look on the gray
face was a reproach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No one could look at Godfrey Cornet and doubt
that he was the veteran of many wars. The battles
he had fought had been those of economic stress,
but they had scarred him none the less. His face
was written over, like an ancient scroll, with deep,
dark lines, and every one marked him as the fighter
he was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every one of his fine features told the same story.
His mouth was hard and grim, but it could smile
with the kindest, most boyish pleasure on occasion.
His nose was like an eagle’s beak, his face was lean
with never a sagging muscle, his eyes, coal black,
had each bright points as of blades of steel. People
always wondered at his trim, erect form, giving
little sign of his advanced years. He still looked
hard as an athlete; and so he was. He had never
permitted “vile luxury’s contagion” to corrupt his
tissues. For all the luxury with which he had surrounded
his wife and son, he himself had always
lived frugally: simple food, sufficient exercise, the
most personal and detailed contact with his great
business. He had fought upward from utter poverty
to the presidency and ownership of one of the
greatest fur houses of his country, partly through
the exercise of the principle of absolute business integrity,
mostly through the sheer dynamic force of
the man. His competitors knew him as a fair but
remorseless fighter; but his fame carried far beyond
the confines of his resident city. Bearded trappers,
running their lines through the desolate wastes of
the North, were used to seeing him come venturing
up their gray rivers in the spring, fur-clad and
wind-tanned,—finding his relaxation and keeping
fit by personally attending to the buying of some of
his furs. Thus it was hard for a soft man to feel
easy in his presence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned Cornet wished that he didn’t have to face
him to-night. The interview, probably short, certainly
courteous, would leave him a vague discomfort
and discontent that could only be alleviated by
further drinks, many of them and strong. But
there was nothing to do but face it. Dependence
was a hard lot; unlike such men as Rodney Coburn
and Rex Nard, Ned had no great income-yielding
capital in his own name. He was somewhat downcast
and sullen as he entered the cheerfully lighted
hallway of his father’s house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the soft light it was immediately evident that
he was his father’s son, yet there were certain
marked differences between them. Warrior blood
had some way failed to come down to Ned. For all
his stalwart body, he gave no particular image of
strength. There was noticeable extra weight at his
abdomen and in the flesh of his neck, and there was
also an undeniable flabbiness of his facial muscles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Godfrey Cornet’s hands and face were peculiarly
trim and hard and brown, but in the bright light
and under careful scrutiny, his son’s showed somewhat
sallow. To a casual observer he showed unmistakable
signs of an easy life and luxurious surroundings;
but the mark of prolonged dissipation
was not immediately evident. Perhaps the little
triangles on either side of his irises were not the
hard, bluish-white they should be; possibly there
was the faintest beginning of a network of fine, red
lines just below the swollen flesh sacks beneath his
eyes. The eyes themselves were black and vivid,
not unlike his father’s; he had a straight, good nose,
a rather crooked, friendly mouth, and the curly
brown hair of a child. As yet there was no real
viciousness in his face. There was amiable weakness,
truly, but plenty of friendly boyishness and
good will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took his place at the stately table so gravely
and quietly that his parent’s interest was at once
wakened. His father smiled quietly at him across
the board.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Ned,” he asked at last. “What is it to-day?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing very much. A very close call, though,
to real tragedy. I might as well tell you about it,
as likely enough it’ll be in the papers to-morrow. I
went into a bad skid at Fourth and Madison, hit a
jitney, and before we got quite stopped managed
to knock a girl over on the pavement. Didn’t hurt
her a particle. But there’s a hundred dollars’ damage
to the jit—and a pretty severe scare for your
young son.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he talked, his eyes met those of his father,
almost as if he were afraid to look away. The older
man made little comment. He went on with his
dessert, and soon the talk veered to other matters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There hadn’t been any kind of a scene, after all.
It was true that his father looked rather drawn and
tired,—more so than usual. Perhaps difficult
problems had come up to-day at the store. His
voice had a peculiar, subdued, quiet note that wasn’t
quite familiar. Ned felt a somber heaviness in the
air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not excuse himself and hurry away as he
had hoped to do. He seemed to feel that to make
such an offer would precipitate some impending
issue that he had no desire to meet. His father’s
thoughts were busy; both his wife and his son
missed the usual absorbingly interesting discourse
that was a tradition at the Cornet table. The older
man finished his coffee, slowly lighted a long, sleek
cigar, and for a moment rested with elbows on the
table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Ned, I suppose I might as well get this
off my chest,” he began at last. “Now is as auspicious
a time as any. You say you got a good
scare to-day. I’m hoping that it put you in a
mood so that at least you can give me a good
hearing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man spoke rather humbly. The air was
electric when he paused. Ned leaned forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It wasn’t anything—that accident to-day,” he
answered in a tone of annoyance. “It could have
happened to any one on slippery pavements. But
that’s ridiculous—about a good hearing. I hope
I always have heard everything you wanted to tell
me, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve been a very attentive son.” Godfrey
Cornet paused again. “The trouble, I’m afraid, is
that I haven’t been a very attentive father. I’ve
attended to my business—and little else—and
now I’m paying the piper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please bear with me. It was only a little accident,
as you say. The trouble of it is that it points
the way that things are going. It could very easily
have been a terrible accident—a dead girl under
your speeding wheels, a charge of manslaughter instead
of the good joke of being arrested for speeding,
a term in the penitentiary instead of a fine.
Ned, if you had killed the girl it would have been
fully right and just for you to spend a good many
of the best years of your life behind prison walls. I
ask myself whether or not I would bring my influence
to bear, in that case, to keep you from going
there. I’m ashamed to say that I would.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may wonder about that. I would know,
in my heart, that you should go there. I am not
sure but that you should go there now, as it is. But
I would also know that I have been criminal too—criminally
neglectful, slothful, avoiding my obligations—just
as much as you have been neglectful
and slothful and avoiding your obligations toward
the other residents of this city when, half-intoxicated,
you drove your car at a breakneck pace
through the city streets. I can’t accuse you without
also accusing myself. Therefore I would try
to keep you out of prison. In doing that, I would
see in myself further proof of my old weakness—a
weak desire to spare you when the prison might
make a man of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned recoiled at the words, but his father threw
him a quick smile. “That cuts a little, doesn’t it?
I can’t help it. Ned, your mother and I have always
loved you too well. I suppose it is one of the
curses of this age—that ease and softness have
made us a hysterical, sentimental people, and we
love our children not wisely, but too well. I’ve
sheltered you, instead of exposing you to the world.
The war did not stiffen you—doubtless because
you were one of the millions that never reached the
front.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned leaned forward. “That wasn’t my fault,”
he said with fire. “You know that wasn’t my
fault.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it wasn’t. The fact remains that you
lost out. Let me go on. I’ve made it easy for
you, always, instead of bitter hard as I should have
done. I’ve surrounded you with luxury instead of
hardship. You’ve never done an honest day’s toil
on earth. You don’t know what it is to sweat, to
be so tired you can’t stand, to wonder where the
next meal is coming from, to know what a hard and
bitter thing life is!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A girl, thrown on the pavement. A working
girl, you said—probably homely, certainly not
your idea of a girl. Perhaps, in your heart, you
think it wouldn’t have much mattered if you had
killed her, except for the awkwardness to you. She
was just one of thousands. You, my son, are Ned
Cornet—one of our city’s most exalted social set,
one of our fashionable young clubmen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His tone had changed to one of unspeakable bitterness.
Ned leaned forward in appeal. “That
isn’t true,” he said sharply. “I’m not a damned
snob!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps not. I’m not sure that I know what
a snob is. I’ve never met one—only men who
have pretended to be snobs to hide their fear of me.
Let me say, though, Ned—whatever her lot, no
matter how menial her toil, your life could be spared
much easier than hers. It would be better that you
should be snuffed out than that she should lose one
of her working hands. Likely you felt superior to
her as you drove her home; in reality you were infinitely
inferior. She has gone much farther than
you have. She knows more of life; she is harder
and better and truer and worth more to this dark
world in which we live. The world could ill afford
to lose her, a fighter, a worker. It would be better
off to lose you—a shirker, a slacker!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not accusing you. God knows the blame is
on my own head. For my part I sprang from the
world of toil—never do I go out into that society
in which you move but that I thank God for the
bitter toil I knew in youth. The reason is that it
has put me infinitely above them. Such soft
friends as you have wither before my eyes, knowing
well that they can not meet me on even grounds; or
else they take refuge in an air of conceit, a pretense
of caste, that deceives themselves no more than it
deceives me. They talk behind my back of my
humble origin—fearfully clothing their own
nakedness with the garments of worthy, fighting
men who have preceded them—and yet their most
exalted gates open before my knock. They dare
not shut their doors to me. They treat me with the
respect that is born of fear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That toil, that hard schooling, has made me
what I am and given me the highest degree possible
of human happiness. I find a satisfaction in living;
I am able to hold my head up among men. I
have health, the adoring love of a wonderful
woman; I give service to the world. I can see old
age coming upon me without regret, without vain
tears for what might have been, without fear for
whatever fate lies beyond. I am schooled for that
fate, Ned. I’ve got strength to meet it. My spirit
will not be buffeted willy-nilly in those winds that
blow between the worlds. I am a man, I’ve done
man’s work, and I can hold my place with other
men in the great trials to come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What those tests are, I do not know. Personally
I lean toward an older theology, one mostly
outworn now, one cast away by weak men because
they are afraid to believe in it. It is not for me to
say that Dante foresaw falsely. The only thing I
can not believe is the legend over the door—‘Abandon
Hope, ye who enter here.’ There is no gateway
here or hereafter that can shut out Hope. I
believe that no matter how terrible the punishment
that lies within those gates, however hard the school,
there is a way through and out at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hell is not the dream of a religious fanatic,
Ned. I believe in it just as surely as I believe in a
heaven. There must be some school, some bitter,
dreadful training camp for those who leave this
world unfitted to go on to a higher, better world.
Lately souls have been going there in ever-increasing
numbers. Let softness and self-indulgence
and luxury continue to degenerate this nation, and
all travel will be in that direction. My hope is yet,
the urge behind all that I’m saying to you to-night,
is that you may take some other way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His black eyes gleamed over the board. For the
moment, he might have been some prophet of old,
preaching the Word to the hosts of Israel. The
long dining room was deathly still as he paused.
Realizing that the intensity of his feeling was wakening
the somber poetry within him, revealing his
inmost, secret nature, he steadied himself, watching
the upcurling smoke of his cigar. When he spoke
again his voice and words were wholly commonplace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no force in heaven or earth so strong as
moral force,” he said. “In the end, nothing can
stand against it. If it dies in this land, Lord help
us—because we will be unable to help ourselves.
We can then no longer drive the heathen from our
walls. With it, we are great—without it we are a
race of weaklings. And with luxury and ease upon
us, it seems to me I see it manifested ever less and
less.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ned, there’s one thing to bring it back—and
that is hardship. I mean by hardship all that is
opposite to ease: self-restraint instead of license;
service instead of self-love; devotion to a cause of
right rather than to pleasure; most of all, hard work
instead of ease. I’ve heard it said, as a thing to be
deplored, that shirt sleeves go to shirt sleeves every
three generations. Thank God it is so. There is
nothing like shirt sleeves, Ned, to make a man—and
hard-working, bunching muscles under them.
And through my own weakness I’ve let those fine
muscles of yours grow flabby and soft.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your mother and I have a lot to answer for.
Both of us were busy, I with my business, she with
her household cares and social duties, and it was
easier to give you what you wanted than to refuse
you things for your own good. It was easier to let
you go soft than to provide hardship for you. It
was pleasanter to give in than to hold out—and we
loved you too much to put you through what we
should have put you through. We excused you
your early excesses. All young men did it, we told
each other—you were merely sowing your wild
oats. Then I found, too late, that I could not interest
you in work—in business. You had always
played, and you didn’t want to stop playing. And
your games weren’t entirely harmless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This thing we’ve talked over before. I’ve
never been firm. I’ve let you grow to man’s years—twenty-nine,
I believe—and still be a child in
experience. The work you do around my business
could be done by a seventeen-year-old boy. You
don’t know what it means to keep a business day.
You come when you like and go when you like. In
your folly you are no longer careful of the rights
of other, better people—or you wouldn’t have
driven as you did to-day. You can no longer be
bright and attractive at dinner except under the
stimulation of cocktails—nothing really vicious
yet, but pointing to the way things are going. Ned,
I want to make a man of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paused again, and their eyes met over the
table. All too plainly the elder Cornet saw that his
appeal had failed to go home. His son was smiling
grimly, his eyes sardonic, unmistakable contempt in
the curl of his lips. Whether he was angry or not
the gray man opposite could not tell. He hoped so
in his heart—that Ned had not sunk so low that he
could no longer know the stirring urge of manly
anger. A great depression drew nigh and enfolded
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This isn’t a theater,” was the calloused reply at
last. “You are not delivering a lecture to America’s
school children! Strangely, I feel quite able
to take care of myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I only wish that I could feel so too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must think I’m a child—to try to scare
me with threats of hell fire. Father, I didn’t realize
that you had this streak of puritanism in you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His father made no reply at first. Ned’s bitter
smile had seemingly passed to his own lips. “I
suppose there’s no use of going on,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By all means go on, since you are so warmed
up to your subject,” Ned answered coldly. “I
wouldn’t like to deprive you of the pleasure. You
had something on your mind: what is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was a real opportunity for you—a chance
to show the stuff you’re made of. It wasn’t much,
truly—perhaps I have taken the whole thing too
seriously. Ned, I wonder if you like excitement.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do I? You know how I love polo——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You love to watch! The point is, do you like
excitement well enough to take a slight risk of your
life for it? Do you care enough about success, on
your own hook, to go through snow and ice to win
it? A chance came to-day to make from fifty to a
hundred thousand dollars for this firm; all it takes
is a little nerve, a little endurance of hardship, a little
love of adventure. I hoped to interest you in
it—by so doing to get you started along the way
that leads to manhood and self-respect. You carry
this off successfully, and it’s bound to give you ambition
to tackle even harder deals. It means contact
with men, a whole world of valuable experience,
and a world of fun to boot. It wouldn’t appeal
to some of your cheap friends—but heaven
knows, if you don’t take it up, I’m going to do it
myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go ahead, shoot!” Ned urged. He smiled
wanly, almost superciliously at the enthusiasm that
had overswept his father’s face. The old man’s
eyes were gleaming like black diamonds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a curious thing, this love of adventure and
trial and achievement! The old man was half-mad,
immersed in the Sunday-school sentiments of a
dead and moth-eaten generation, yet it was marvelous
the joy that he got out of living! He was
one of an older generation, or he would never anticipate
pleasure in projects that incurred hardship,
work, responsibility, the silences of the waste places
such as he knew on his annual fur-buying expeditions.
His sense of pleasure was weird; yet he was
consistent, to say the least. Now he was wildly
elated from merely <span class='it'>thinking</span> about his great scheme,—doubtless
some stupid plan to add further prestige
to the great fur house of Godfrey Cornet.
Ned himself could not find such happiness in twice
the number of drinks that were his usual wont.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s simply this,” his father went on, barely able
to curb his enthusiasm. “To-day I met Leo
Schaffner at lunch, and in our talk he gave me what
I consider a real business inspiration. He tells me,
in his various jobbing houses, he has several thousand
silk and velvet gowns and coats and wraps left
on his hands in the financial depression that immediately
followed the war. He was cussing his luck
because he didn’t know what to do with them. Of
course they were part of the surplus that helped
glut the markets when hard times made people stop
buying—stock that was manufactured during the
booming days of the war. He told me that this
finery was made of the most beautiful silks and velvets,
but all of it was a good three seasons out of
style. He offered me the lot of two thousand for—I’m
ashamed to tell you how much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Almost nothing!” his son prompted him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Almost nothing. And I took him up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His son leaned back, keenly interested for the
first time. “Good Lord, why? You can’t go into
business selling out-of-date women’s clothes!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t, eh? Son, while he was talking to me, it
occurred to me all at once that the least of those
gowns, the poorest one in the lot, was worth at least
a marten skin! Think of it! A marten skin, from
Northern Canada and Alaska, returned the trapper
around sixty dollars in 1920. Now let me get
down to brass tacks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s true I don’t intend to sell any of those hairy
old white trappers any women’s silk gowns. But
this was what I was going to have you do: first you
were to hire a good auxiliary schooner—a strong,
sturdy, seaworthy two-masted craft such as is used
in northern trading. You’d fit that craft out with
a few weeks’ supplies and fill the hold with a couple
of thousand of those gowns. You’d need two or
three men to run the launch—I believe the usual
crew is a pilot, a first and second engineer, and a
cook—and you’d have to have a seamstress to do
fitting and make minor alterations. Then you’d
start up for Bering Sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may not know it, but along the coast of
Alaska, and throughout the islands of Bering Sea
there are hundreds of little, scattered tribes of Indians,
all of them trappers of the finest, high-priced
furs. Nor do their women dress in furs and skins
altogether, either, as popular legend would have
you believe. Through their hot, long summer days
they wear dresses like American women, and the
gayer and prettier the dresses, the better they like
’em. To my knowledge, no one has ever fed them
silk—simply because silk was too high—but being
women, red or white, they’d simply go crazy
over it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The other factor in the combination is that the
<span class='it'>Intrepid</span>, due to the unsettled fur market, failed to
do any extensive buying on her last annual trading
trip through the islands, and as a result practically
all the Indians have their full catch on hand. The
<span class='it'>Intrepid</span> is the only trader through the particular
chain of islands I have in mind—the Skopin group,
north and east of the Aleutian chain—and she’s
not counting on going up again till spring. Then
she’ll reap a rich harvest—unless you get there
first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Skopin Islands are charted—any that are
inhabited at all—easy to find, easy to get to with
a seaworthy launch. Every one of those Indians
you’ll find there will buy a dress for his squaw or
his daughter to show off in, during the summer, and
pay for it with a fine piece of fur. For some of the
brighter, richer gowns I haven’t any doubt but that
you could get blue and silver fox. As I say, the
worst of ’em is worth at least a single marten. Considering
your lack of space, I’d limit you to marten,
blue and silver fox, fisher and mink, and perhaps
such other freak furs as would bring a high price—no
white fox or muskrat or beaver, perhaps not even
ermine and land otter. Ply along from island to
island, starting north and working south and west
clear out among the Aleuts, to keep out of the way
of the winter, showing your dresses at the Indian
villages and trading them for furs!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is August. I’m already arranging for a
license. You’d have to get going in a week. Hit
as far north as you want—the farther you go the
better you will do—and then work south. Making
a big chain that cuts off the currents and the
tides, the Skopin group is surrounded by an unbroken
ice sheet in midwinter, so you have to count
on rounding the Aleutian Peninsula into Pacific
waters some time in November. If you wait much
longer you’re apt not to get out before spring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the whole story. The cargo of furs you
should bring out should be worth close to a hundred
thousand. Expenses won’t be fifteen thousand in
all. It would mean work; dealing with a bunch of
crafty redskins isn’t play for boys! Maybe there’d
be cold and rough weather, for Bering Sea deserves
no man’s trust. But it would be the finest sport in
the world, an opportunity to take Alaskan bear and
tundra caribou—plenty of adventure and excitement
and tremendous profits to boot. It would be
a man’s job, Ned—but you’d get a kick out of it
you never got out of a booze party in your life.
And we split the profits seventy-five—twenty-five—the
lion’s share to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He waited, to watch Ned’s face. The young
man seemed to be musing. “I could use fifty thousand,
pretty neat,” he observed at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—and don’t forget the fun you’d have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But good Lord, think of it. Three months
away from Second Avenue.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The finest three months of your life—worth
all the rest of your stupid, silly past time put together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Almost trembling in his eagerness, the old man
waited for his son’s reply. The latter took out a
cigarette, lighted it, and gazed meditatively through
the smoke. “Fifty thousand!” he whispered
greedily. “And I suppose I could stand the hardship.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he looked up, faintly smiling. “I’ll go, if
Lenore will let me,” he pronounced at last.</p>

<div><h1>III</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> exact moment that her name was on Ned’s
lips, Lenore Hardenworth herself, in her apartment
in a region of fashionable apartments eight blocks
from the Cornet home, was also wondering at the
perverse ways of parents. It was strange how their
selfish interests could disarrange one’s happiest
plans. All in all, Lenore was in a wretched mood,
savagely angry at the world in general and her
mother in particular.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had had a rather unpleasant half-hour over
their cigarettes. Mrs. Hardenworth had been obdurate;
Lenore’s prettiest pouts and most winsome
ways hadn’t moved her a particle. The former
knew all such little wiles; time was when she had
practiced them herself with consummate art, and
she was not likely to be taken in with them in her
old age! Seeing that these were fruitless, her
daughter had taken the more desperate stand of
anger, always her last resort in getting what she
wanted, but to-night it some way failed in the desired
effect. There had been almost, if not quite, a
scene between these two handsome women under
the chandelier’s gleam—and the results, from Lenore’s
point of view, had been absolutely nil. Mrs.
Hardenworth had calmly stood her ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the way of the old, Lenore reflected, to
give too much of their thought and interest to their
own fancied ills. Not even a daughter’s brilliant
career could stand between. And who would have
guessed that the “nervousness” her mother had
complained of so long, pandered to by a fashionable
quack and nursed like a baby by the woman herself,
should ever lead to such disquieting results. The
doctor had recommended a sea voyage to the
woman, and the old fool had taken him at his word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not that Lenore felt she could not spare,
for some months, her mother’s guiding influence.
It was merely that sea voyages cost money, and
money, at that particular time, was scarce and
growing scarcer about the Hardenworth apartment.
Lenore needed all that was available for her
own fall and winter gowns, a mink or marten coat
to take the place of her near-seal cloak, and for such
entertaining as would be needed to hold her place in
her own set. Seemingly the only course that remained
was to move forward the date of her marriage
to Ned, at present set for the following
spring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She dried her eyes, powdered her nose; and for
all the late storm made a bewitching picture as she
tripped to the door in answer to her fiancé’s knock.
Lenore Hardenworth was in all probability the
most beautiful girl in her own stylish set and one of
the most handsome women in her native city. She
was really well known, remembered long and in
many places, for her hair. It was simply shimmering
gold, and it framed a face of flowerlike beauty,—an
even-featured, oval face, softly tinted and
daintily piquant. Hers was not a particularly
warm beauty, yet it never failed to win a second
glance. She had fine, firm lips, a delicate throat,
and she had picked up an attractive way of half-dropping
firm, white lids over her gray, langourous
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No one could wonder that Lenore Hardenworth
was a social success. Besides her beauty of face,
the grace of a slender but well-muscled form, she
unquestionably had a great deal of ambition and
spirit. She was well schooled in the tricks of her
trade: charming and ingratiating with her girl
friends, sweet and deeply respectful to the old, and
striking a fine balance between recklessness and demureness
with available men. It can be said for
Lenore that she wasted no time with men who were
not eligible, in every sense of the word. Lenore
had her way to make in this world of trial and stress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Long ago Ned had chosen her from among her
girl friends as the most worthy of his courtship,—a
girl who could rule over his house, who loved the
life that he lived, whose personal appeal was the
greatest. Best of all, she was the product of his
own time: a modern girl in every sense of the word.
The puritanism he deplored in his own parents was
conspicuously absent in her. She smoked with the
ease and satisfaction of a man; she held her liquor
like a veteran; and of prudery she would never be
accused. Not that she was ever rough or crude.
Indeed there was a finesse about her harmless little
immoralities that made them, to him, wholly adorable
and charming. She was always among the
first to learn the new dances, and no matter what
their murky origin—whether the Barbary Coast or
some sordid tenderloin of a great Eastern city—she
seemed to be able to dance them without ever
conveying the image of vulgarity. Her idea of
pleasure ran along with his. Life, at her side,
offered only the most delectable vistas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Besides, the man loved her. His devotion was
such that it was the subject of considerable amusement
among the more sophisticated of their set.
He’d take the <span class='it'>egg</span>, rather than the <span class='it'>horse-and-buggy</span>,
they told each other, and to those inured in the
newest slang, the meaning was simply that Lenore,
rather than Ned, would be head of their house.
The reason, they explained wisely, was that it
spelled disaster to give too much of one’s self to a
wife these days. Such devotion put a man at a disadvantage.
The woman, sure of her husband,
would be speedily bored and soon find other interests.
Of course Lenore loved him too, but she kept
herself better in hand. For all his modern viewpoint,
it was to be doubted that Ned had got completely
away from the influence of a dead and moth-eaten
generation. Possibly some little vestige of
his parent’s puritanism prevailed in him still!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned came in soberly, kissed the girl’s inviting
lips, then sat beside her on the big divan. Studying
his grave face, she waited for him to speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bad news,” he said at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She caught her breath in a quick gasp. It was a
curious thing, indicating, perhaps, a more devout
interest in him than her friends gave her credit for,
that a sudden sense of dismay seemed to sweep over
her. Yet surely no great disaster had befallen.
There was no cause to fear that some one of the
mighty arms on which they leaned for happiness—the
great fur house of Cornet, for instance—had
weakened and fallen. Some of the warm color
paled in her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” She spoke almost breathlessly,
and he turned toward her with wakened interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing very important,” he told her casually.
“I’m afraid I startled you with my lugubrious
tones. I’ve got to go away for three months.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stared a moment in silence, and a warm flush,
higher and more angry than that which had just
faded, returned to her cheeks. Just for an instant
there was a vague, almost imperceptible hardening
of the little lines about her beautiful eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ned! You can’t! After all our plans. I
won’t hear of it——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait, dearest!” the man pleaded. “Of course
I won’t go if you say not——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I say not——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it’s a real opportunity—to make forty or
fifty thousand. Wait till I tell you about it, anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He told her simply: the exact plan that his father
had proposed. Her interest quickened as he talked.
She had a proper respect for wealth, and the idea
of the large profits went home speedily and surely
to her imagination, shutting out for the moment all
other aspects of the affair. And soon she found
herself sitting erect, listening keenly to his every
word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The idea of trading obsolete gowns for beautiful
furs was particularly attractive to her. “I’ve got
some old things I could spare,” she told him eagerly.
“Why couldn’t you take those with you and trade
them to some old squaw for furs?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could! I don’t see why I shouldn’t bring you
back some beauties.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes were suddenly lustful. “I’d like some
silver fox—and enough sable for a great wrap.
Oh, Ned—do you think you could get them for
me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His face seemed rather drawn and mirthless as
he returned her stare. It had been too complete a
victory. It can be said for the man that he had
come with the idea of persuading Lenore to let him
go, to let him leave her arms for the sake of the advantages
to be accrued from the expedition, but at
least he wanted her to show some regret. He didn’t
entirely relish her sudden, unbounded enthusiasm,
and the avaricious gleam in her eyes depressed and
estranged him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Lenore made no response to his darkened
mood. Sensitive as she usually was, she seemed
untouched by it, wholly unaware of his displeasure.
She was thinking of silver fox, and the thought was
as fascinating as that of gold to a miser. And now
her mind was reaching farther, moving in a greater
orbit, and for the moment she sat almost breathless.
Suddenly she turned to him with shining eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ned, what kind of a trip will this be?” she
asked him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was more held by the undertone of excitement
in her voice than by the question itself. “What is
it?” he asked. “What do you mean——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean—will it be a hard trip—one of danger
and discomfort?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think so. I’m going to get a comfortable
yacht—it will be a launch, of course, but a big,
comfortable one—have a good cook and pleasant
surroundings. You know, traveling by water has
got any other method skinned. In fact, it ought
to be as comfortable as staying at a club, not to
mention the sport in hunting, and so on. I don’t
intend to go too far or too long—your little Ned
doesn’t like discomfort any too well to deliberately
hunt it up. I can make it just as easy a trip as I
want. It’s all in my hands—hiring crew, schooner,
itinerary, and everything. Of course, father told a
wild story about cold and hardship and danger, but
I don’t believe there’s a thing in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t either. It makes me laugh, those wild
and woolly stories about the North! It’s just about
as wild as Ballard! Edith Courtney went clear to
Juneau and back on a boat not long ago and didn’t
have a single adventure—except with a handsome
young big-game hunter in the cabin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Juneau—is just the beginning of
Alaska!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t care. This hardship they talk about is
all poppycock, and you know it—and the danger
too. To hear your father talk, and some of the
others of the older generation, you’d think they had
been through the infernal regions! They didn’t
have the sporting instincts that’ve been developed
in the last generation, Ned. Any one of our friends
would go through what they went through and not
even bother to tell about it. I tell you this generation
is better and stronger than any one that preceded
it, and their stories of privation and danger
are just a scream! I’m no more afraid of the North
than I am of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She paused, and he stared at her blankly. He
knew perfectly well that some brilliant idea had occurred
to her: he was simply waiting for her to tell
it. She moved nearer and slipped her hand between
his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ned, I’ve a wonderful plan,” she told him.
“There’s no reason why we should be separated for
three months. You say the hiring of the launch,
itinerary, and everything is in your hands. Why
not take mother and me with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not? Tell me that! The doctor has just
recommended her a sea trip. Where could she get
a better one? Of course you’d have to get a big,
comfortable launch——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I intended to get that, anyway.” Slowly the
light that shone in her face stole into his. “Are you
a good sailor——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It just happens that neither mother nor I know
what sea-sickness means. Otherwise, I’m afraid we
wouldn’t find very much pleasure in the trip. You
remember the time, in Rex Nard’s yacht, off Columbia
River bar? But won’t you be in the inside
passage, anyway?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The inside passage doesn’t go across the Bay of
Alaska—but father says it’s all quiet water among
the islands we’ll trade at, in Bering Sea. It freezes
over tight in winter, so it must be quiet.” He
paused, drinking in the advantages of the plan.
They would be together; that point alone was inducement
enough for him. By one stroke an arduous,
unpleasant business venture could be turned
into a pleasure trip, an excursion on a private yacht
over the wintry waters of the North. It was true
that Lenore’s point of view was slightly different,
but her enthusiasm was no less than his. The plan
was a perfect answer to the problem of her mother’s
sea trip and the inevitable expense involved. She
knew her mother’s thrifty disposition; she would be
only too glad to take her voyage as the guest of her
daughter’s fiancé. And both of them could robe
themselves in such furs as had never been seen on
Second Avenue before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take you—I should say I will take you—and
your mother, too,” he was exclaiming with the
utmost enthusiasm and delight. “Lenore, it will
be a <span class='it'>regular</span> party—a joy-ride such as we never
took before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment they were silent, lost in their own
musings. The wind off the Sound signaled to them
at the windows—rattling faintly like ghost hands
stretched with infinite difficulty from some dim,
far-off Hereafter. It had lately blown from Bering
Sea, and perhaps it had a message for them.
Perhaps it had heard the scornful words they had
spoken of the North—of the strange, gray, forgotten
world over which it had lately swept—but
there was no need to tell them that they lied. A
few days more would find them venturing northward,
and they could find out for themselves. But
perhaps the wind had a note of grim, sardonic
laughter as it sped on in its ceaseless journey.</p>

<div><h1>IV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Ned</span> planned to rise early, but sleep was heavy
upon him when he tried to waken. It was after ten
when he had finished breakfast and was ready to
begin active preparations for the excursion. His
first work, of course, was to see about hiring a
launch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ten minutes’ ride took him to the office of his
friend, Rex Nard, vice-president of a great marine-outfitting
establishment, and five minutes’ conversation
with this gentleman told him all he wanted
to know. Yes, as it happened Nard knew of a
corking craft that was at that moment in need of
a charterer, possibly just the thing that Cornet
wanted. The only difficulty, Nard explained, was
that it was probably a much better schooner than
was needed for casual excursions into northern
waters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This particular craft was built for a scientific
expedition sent out by one of the great museums,”
Nard explained. “It isn’t just a fisherman’s scow.
She has a nifty galley and a snug little dining saloon,
and two foxy little staterooms for extra toney
passengers. Quite an up-stage little boat. Comfortable
as any yacht you ever saw.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Staunch and seaworthy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Man, this big-spectacled outfit that had it built
took it clear into the Arctic Sea—after walrus and
polar bear and narwhal and musk ox; and she’s built
right. I’d cross the Pacific in her any day. Her
present owners bought her with the idea of putting
her into coastal service, both passengers and freight,
between various of the little far northern towns,
but the general exodus out of portions of Alaska
has left her temporarily without a job.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How about cargo space?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know exactly—but it was big enough
for several tons of walrus and musk ox skeletons,
so it ought to suit you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think I could get her for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think—I know. I was talking to her
owner yesterday noon. You can get her for ninety
days for five thousand dollars—seventy-five per
for a shorter time. That includes the services of
four men, licensed pilot, first and second engineer,
and a nigger cook; and gas and oil for the motor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned stood up, his black eyes sparkling with
elation, and put on his hat. “Where do I find
her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hunt up Ole Knutsen, at this address.” Nard
wrote an instant on a strip of paper. “The name
of the craft is the <span class='it'>Charon</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The <span class='it'>Charon</span>! My heavens, wasn’t he the old
boy who piloted the lost souls across the river Styx?
If I were a bit superstitious——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d be afraid you were headed straight for
the infernal regions, eh? It does seem to be tempting
providence to ride in a boat with such a name.
Fortunately the average man Knutsen hires for his
crew doesn’t know Charon from Adam. Seamen,
my boy, are the most superstitious crowd on earth.
No one can follow the sea and not be superstitious—don’t
ask me why. It gets to them, some way,
inside.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry I can’t stay to hear a lecture on the subject.”
Ned turned toward the door. “Now for
Mr. Knutsen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned drove to the designated address, found the
owner of the craft, and executed a charter after ten
minutes of conversation. Knutsen was a big, good-natured
man with a goodly share of Norse blood
that had paled his eyes and hair. Together they
drew up the list of supplies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, we might put in some of dis stuff
at nordern ports,” Knutsen told him in the unmistakable
accent of the Norse. “You’d save money,
though, by getting it here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All except one item—last but not least,” Ned
assured him. “I’ve got to stop at Vancouver.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Canadian territory, eh——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Canadian whisky. Six cases of imperial quarts.
We’ll be gone a long time, and a sailor needs his
grog.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At which the only comment was made after the
door had closed and the aristocratic fur trader had
gone his way. The Norseman sat a long time looking
into the ashes of his pipe. “Six cases—by
Yiminy!” he commented, with good cheer. “If
his Pop want to make money out of dis deal he better
go himself!”</p>

<hr class='tbk101'/>

<p class='pindent'>There was really very little else for Ned to do.
The silk gowns and wraps that were to be his principal
article of trade would not be received for a
few days at least; and seemingly he had arranged
for everything. He started leisurely back toward
his father’s office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But yes, there was one thing more. His father
had said that his staff must include a fitter,—a
woman who could ply the needle and make minor
alterations in the gowns. For a moment he mused
on the pleasant possibility that Lenore and her
mother could hold up that end of the undertaking.
It would give them something to do, an interest in
the venture; it would save the cost of hiring a
seamstress. But at once he laughed at himself for
the thought. He could imagine the frigid, caste-proud
Mrs. Hardenworth in the rôle of seamstress!
In the first place she likely didn’t know one end of
a needle from another. If in some humble days
agone she had known how to sew, she was not the
type that would care to admit it now. He had to
recognize this fact, even though she were his sweetheart’s
mother. Nor would she be likely to take
kindly to the suggestion. The belligerence with
which she had always found it necessary to support
her assumption of caste would manifest itself only
too promptly should he suggest that she become a
needlewoman, even on a lark. Such larks appealed
to neither Mrs. Hardenworth nor her daughter.
And neither of them would care for such intimate
relations with the squaws, native of far northern
villages. The two passengers could scarcely be induced
to speak to such as these, much less fit their
dresses. No, he might as well plan on taking one
of his father’s fitters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And at this point in his thoughts he paused,
startled. Later, when the idea that had come to him
had lost its novelty, he still wondered about that
strange little start that seemed to go all over him.
It was some time before he could convince himself
of the real explanation—that, though seamstress
she was, on a plane as far different from his own
Lenore as night was from day, the friendliness and
particularly the good sportsmanship of his last
night’s victim had wakened real gratitude and
friendship for her. He felt really gracious toward
her, and since it was necessary that the expedition
include a seamstress, it would not be bad at all to
have her along. She had shown the best of taste on
the way home after the accident, and certainly she
would offend Lenore’s and his own sensibilities less
than the average of his father’s employees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knew where he could procure some one to do
the fitting. Had not Bess Gilbert, when he had
left her at her door the previous evening, told him
that she knew all manner of needlecraft? Her well-modeled,
athletic, though slender form could endure
such hardships as the work involved; and she had
the temperament exactly needed: adventurous, uncomplaining,
courageous. He turned at once out
Madison where Bess lived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was at work at that hour, a gray, sweet-faced
woman told him, but he was given directions where
he might find her. Ten minutes later he was talking
to the young lady herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wholly without warmth, just like the matter of
business that it was, he told her his plan and offered
her the position. It was for ninety days, he
said, and owing to the nature of the work, irregular
hours and more or less hardship, her pay would be
twice that which she received in the city. Would
she care to go?</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked up at him with blue eyes smiling,—a
smile that crept down to her lips for all that she
tried to repel it. She looked straight into Ned’s
eyes as she answered him simply, candidly, quite
like a social equal instead of a lowly employee.
And there was a lilt in her voice that caught Ned’s
attention in spite of himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t had many opportunities for ocean
travel,” she told him—and whether or not she was
laughing at him Ned Cornet couldn’t have sworn!
Her tone was certainly suspiciously merry. “Mr.
Cornet, I’ll be glad enough to accompany your
party, any time you say.”</p>

<div><h1>V</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> was a jesting, hilarious crowd that gathered
one sunlit morning to watch the departure of the
<span class='it'>Charon</span>. Rodney Coburn was there, and Rex
Nard, various matrons who were members of Mrs.
Hardenworth’s bridge club, and an outer and inner
ring of satellites that gyrated around such social
suns as Ned and Lenore. Every one was very
happy, and no one seemed to take the expedition
seriously. The idea of Ned Cornet, he of the curly
brown hair, in the rôle of fur trader in the frozen
wastes of the North appealed to his friends as being
irresistibly comic. The nearest approach to seriousness
was Coburn’s envy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to be in your shoes,” he told Ned.
“Just think—a chance to take a tundra caribou,
a Kodiac bear, and maybe a polar bear and a walrus—all
in one swoop! I’ll have to hand over my
laurels as a big-game hunter when you get back,
old boy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lewis and Clark, Godspeed!” Ted Wynham,
known among certain disillusioned newspaper men
as “the court jester”, announced melodramatically
from a snubbing block. “In token of our esteem
and good wishes, we wish to present you with this
magic key to success and happiness.” He held out
a small bundle, the size of a jack-knife, carefully
wrapped. “You are going North, my children!
You, Marco Polo”—he bowed handsomely to
Ned—“and you, our lady of the snows,”—addressing
Lenore—“and last but not least, the
chaperone”—bowing still lower to Mrs. Hardenworth,
a big, handsome woman with iron-gray hair
and large, even features—“will find full use for
the enclosed magic key in the wintry, barbarous,
but blessed lands of the North. Gentleman and
ladies, you are not venturing into a desert. Indeed,
it is a land flowing with milk and honey. And
this little watch charm, first aid to all explorers, the
friend of all dauntless travelers such as yourselves,
explorers’ delight, in fact, will come in mighty
handy! Accept it, with our compliments!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He handed the package to Ned, and a great
laugh went up when he revealed its contents. It
contained a gold-mounted silver cork-screw!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both Lenore and her mother seemed in a wonderful
mood. The ninety-day journey on those
far-stretching sunlit waters seemed to promise only
happiness for them. Mrs. Hardenworth was getting
her sea trip, and under the most pleasant conditions.
There would also, it seemed, be certain
chances for material advantages, none of which she
intended to overlook. In her trunk she had various
of her own gowns—some of them slightly worn,
it was true; some of them stained and a trifle musty—yet
suddenly immensely valuable in her eyes.
She had intended to give them to the first charity
that would condescend to accept them, but now she
didn’t even trust her own daughter with them.
Somewhere in those lost and desolate islands of the
North she intended trading them for silver fox!
Ned had chest upon chest of gowns to trade; surely
she would get a chance to work in her own. Her
daughter looked forward to the same profitable
enterprise, and besides, she had the anticipation of
three wonderful, happy months’ companionship
with the man of her choice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had dressed according to their idea of the
occasion. Lenore wore a beautifully tailored middy
suit that was highly appropriate for summer seas,
but was nothing like the garb that Esquimo women
wear in the fall journeys in the Oomiacs. Mrs.
Hardenworth had a smart tailored suit of small
black and white check, a small hat and a beautiful
gray veil. Both of them carried winter coats, and
both were fitted out with binoculars, cameras, and
suchlike oceanic paraphernalia. Knutsen, of course,
supposed that their really heavy clothes, great
mackinaws and slickers and leather-lined woolens,
such as are sometimes needed on Bering Sea, were
in the trunks he had helped to stow below. In this
regard the blond seaman, helmsman and owner of
the craft, had made a slight mistake. In a desire
for a wealth of silver fox to wear home both trunks
had been filled with discarded gowns to the exclusion
of almost everything else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned, in a smart yachting costume, had done
rather better by himself. He had talked with Coburn
in regard to the outfit, and his duffle bag contained
most of the essentials for such a journey.
And Bess’s big, plain bag was packed full of the
warmest clothes she possessed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bess did not stand among the happy circle of
Ned’s friends. Her mother and sister had come
down to the dock to bid her good-by, and they
seemed to be having a very happy little time among
themselves. Bess herself was childishly happy in
the anticipation of the adventure. Hard would
blow the wind that could chill her, and mighty the
wilderness power that could break her spirit!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The captain was almost ready to start the launch.
McNab, the chief engineer, was testing his engines;
Forest, his assistant, stood on the deck; and the
negro cook stood grinning at the window of the
galley. But presently there was an abrupt cessation
of the babble of voices in the group surrounding
Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only Ted Wynham’s voice was left, trailing on
at the high pitch he invariably used in trying to
make himself heard in a noisy crowd. It sounded
oddly loud, now that the laughter had ceased. Ted
paused in the middle of a word, startled by the silence,
and a secret sense of vague embarrassment
swept all his listeners. A tall man was pushing
through the crowd, politely asking right of way,
his black eyes peering under silver brows. For
some inexplicable reason the sound of frolic died
before his penetrating gaze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the groups caught themselves at once. They
must not show fear of this stalwart, aged man with
his prophet’s eyes. They spoke to him, wishing
him good day, and he returned their bows with
faultless courtesy. An instant later he stood before
his son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother couldn’t get down,” Godfrey Cornet
said simply. “She sent her love and good wishes.
A good trip, Ned—but not too good a trip.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not—too good a trip?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A little snow, a little cold—maybe a charging
Kodiac bear—fine medicine for the spirit, Ned.
Good luck!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gave his hand, then turned to extend good
wishes to Mrs. Hardenworth and Lenore. He
seemed to have a queer, hesitant manner when he
addressed the latter, as if he had planned to give
some further, more personal message, but now was
reconsidering it. Then the little group about him
suddenly saw his face grow vivid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s Miss Gilbert——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The group looked from one to another. As always,
they were paying the keenest attention to his
every word; but they could not remember hearing
this name before. “Miss Gilbert?” his son echoed
blankly. “Oh, you mean the seamstress——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course—the other member of your party.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s right there, talking to her mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A battery of eyes was suddenly turned on the
girl. Seemingly she had been merely part of the
landscape before, unnoticed except by such clandestine
gaze as Ted Wynham bent upon her; but
in an instant, because Godfrey Cornet had known
her name, she became a personage of at least some
small measure of importance. Without knowing
why she did it, Mrs. Hardenworth drew herself up
to her full height.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cornet walked courteously to the girl’s side and
extended his hand. “Good luck to you, and a
pleasant journey,” he said, smiling down on her.
“And, Miss Gilbert, I wonder if I could give you
a charge——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll do my best—anything you ask——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want you to look after my son Ned. He’s
never been away from the comforts of civilization
before—and if a button came off, he’d never know
how to put it on. Don’t let him come to grief, Miss
Gilbert. I’m wholly serious—I know what the
North is. Don’t let him take too great a risk.
Watch out for his health. There’s nothing in this
world like a woman’s care.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no ring of laughter behind him. No
one liked to take the chance that he was jesting,
and no one could get away from the uncomfortable
feeling that he might be in earnest. Bess’s reply
was entirely grave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll remember all you told me,” she told him
simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you—and a pleasant voyage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even now the adventurers were getting aboard.
Mrs. Hardenworth was handing her bag to Knutsen—she
had mistaken him for a cabin boy—with instructions
to carry it carefully and put it in her
stateroom; Lenore was bidding a joyous farewell
to some of her more intimate friends. The engine
roared, the water churned beneath the propeller,
the pilot called some order in a strident voice. The
boat moved easily from the dock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swiftly it sped out into the Sound. A great
shout was raised from the dock, hands waved, farewell
words blew over the sunlit waters. But there
was one of the four seafarers on the deck who
seemed neither to hear nor to see. He stood silent,
a profundity of thought upon him never experienced
before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was wondering at the reality of the clamor
on the shore. How many were there in the farewell
party who after a few weeks would even remember
his existence? If the blond man at the wheel were
in reality Charon, piloting him to some fabled underworld
from which he could never return, how
quickly he would be forgotten, how soon they
would fail to speak his name! He felt peculiarly
depressed, inwardly baffled, deeply perplexed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Were all his associations this same fraud? Was
there nothing real or genuine in all the fabric of his
life? As he stood erect, gazing out over the shimmering
waters, Lenore suddenly gazed at him in
amazement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the moment there was a striking resemblance
to his father about his lips and in the unfathomable
blackness of his eyes. Her own reaction was a
violent start, a swift feeling of apprehension that
she could not analyze or explain. Her instincts
were sure and true: she must not let this side of him
gain the ascendency. Her very being seemed to
depend on that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But swiftly she called him from his preoccupation.
She had something to show him, she said,—a
parting gift that Ted Wynham had left in her
stateroom. It was a dark bottle of a famous
whisky, and it would suffice their needs, he had said,
until they should reach Vancouver.</p>

<div><h1>VI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Hardenworth</span> had made it a point to go
immediately to her stateroom, but at once she reappeared
on deck. She seemed a trifle more erect,
her gray eyes singularly wide open.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ned, dear, I wonder if that fellow made a mistake
when he pointed out my stateroom,” she began
rather stiffly. “I want to be sure I’ve got the right
one that you meant for me——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the one to the right,” Ned answered, somewhat
unhappily. He followed her along the deck,
indicating the room she and her daughter were to
occupy. “Did you think he was slipping something
over on you, taking a better one himself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t know. You can’t ever tell about such
men, Ned; you know that very well. Of course, if
it is the one you intended for me, I’m only too delighted
with it——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s really the best on the ship. It’s not a big
craft, you know; space is limited. I’m sorry it’s so
small and dark, and I suppose you’ve already
missed the running water. I do hope it won’t be
too uncomfortable. Of course, you can have the
one on the other side, but it’s really inferior to
this——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the only other one? Ned, I want you to
have the best one——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry to say I’m not going to have any.
Miss Gilbert has to have the other. But there’s a
corking berth in the pilot house I’m going to occupy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d never let Miss Gilbert have it!” The
woman’s eyes flashed. “I wouldn’t hear of
it—you putting yourself out for your servant.
Why can’t she occupy the berth in the pilot
house——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t mind at all. Really I don’t. The girl
couldn’t be expected to sleep where there are men
on watch all night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a shame, just the same. Here she is going
to have one of the two best staterooms all to herself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At once she returned to her room; but the little
scene was not without results. In the first place it
implanted a feeling of injury in Ned, whose habits
of mind made him singularly open to suggestion;
and in the second it left Mrs. Hardenworth with a
distinct prejudice against Bess. She was in a decided
ill-humor until tea time, when she again
joined Ned and Lenore on the deck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was not able to resist the contagion of their
own high spirits, and soon she was joining in their
chat. Everything made for happiness to-day. The
air was cool and bracing, the blue waters glittered
in the sun, a quartering wind filled the sails of the
<span class='it'>Charon</span>, and with the help of the auxiliary engines
whisked her rollicking northward. None of the
three could resist a growing elation, a holiday mood
such as had lately come but rarely and which was
wholly worth celebrating. Soon Ned excused himself,
but reappeared at once with Ted Wynham’s
parting gift.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a rare day,” he announced solemnly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And heavens! We haven’t christened the
ship!” Lenore added drolly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Children, children! Not yet a day out! But
you mustn’t overdo it, either of you!” Mrs. Hardenworth
shook her finger to caution them. “Now,
Ned, have the colored man bring three glasses and
water. I’d prefer ginger ale with mine if you don’t
mind—I’m dreadfully old-fashioned in that regard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment later all three had watered their
liquor to their taste, and were nodding the first
“here’s how!” Then they talked quietly, enjoying
the first stir of the stimulant in their veins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through the glass window of the cabin whence
she had gone to read a novel Bess watched that
first imbibing with lively interest. It was her first
opportunity to observe her social superiors in their
moments of relaxation, and she didn’t quite know
what to make of it. It was not that she was wholly
unfamiliar with drinking on the part of women.
She had known unfortunate girls, now and again,
who had been brought to desolation by this very
thing, but she had always associated it with squalor
and brutality rather than culture and luxury. And
she was particularly impressed with the casual way
these two beautiful women took down their staggering
doses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They didn’t seem to know what whisky was.
They drank it like so much water. Evidently they
had little respect for the demon that dwells in such
poisoned waters,—a respect that in her, because
of her greater knowledge of life, was an innate fear.
They were like children playing with matches.
She felt at first an instinct to warn them, to tell
them in that direction lay all that was terrible and
deadly, but instantly she knew that such a course
would only make her ridiculous in their eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Bess needn’t have felt surprise. Their attitude
was only reflective of the recklessness that had
come to be the dominant spirit of her age,—at
least among those classes from whom, because of
their culture and sophistication, the nation could
otherwise look for its finest ideals. She saw them
take a second drink, and later, ostensibly hidden
from Mrs. Hardenworth’s eyes, Ned and Lenore
have a sma’ wee one together, around the corner of
the pilot house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With that third drink the little gathering on the
deck began to have the proportions of a “party.”
Of course, no one was drunk. Mrs. Hardenworth
was an old spartan at holding her liquor;
Lenore and Ned were merely stimulated and talkative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The older woman concealed the bottle in her
stateroom, but the effects of what had already been
consumed did not at once pass away. Their recklessness
increased: it became manifest, to some
small degree, in speech. Once or twice Ned’s quips
were a shade off-color, but always rollicking laughter
was the response: once Mrs. Hardenworth, half
without thinking, turned a phrase in such a way
that a questionable inference could hardly be
avoided.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, mama!” Lenore exclaimed, in mock
amazement. “Thank heaven you’ve got the grace
to blush.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wicked old woman,” Ned followed up with
pretended gravity. “What if our little needlewoman
had heard you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In reality Bess Gilbert had overheard the remark,
as well as some of Ned’s quips that had
preceded it, and had been almost unable to believe
her ears. It was not that she was particularly ingenuous
or innocent. As an employee in a great
factory she had a knowledge of life beyond any
that these two tenderly bred women could have
hoped to gain. But always before she had associated
such speech with ill-bred and vulgar people
with whom she would not permit herself to associate,
never with those who in their attitude and
thought presumed to be infinitely her superior.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was not lacking in good sense; so she gave
no sign of having heard. She wondered, however,
just how she would have received such sallies had
she been properly a member of their party. Wholly
independent, with a world of moral courage to support
her convictions, she could not have joined in
the laughter that followed, even to avoid being conspicuous.
It would have been a situation of real
embarrassment to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conclusion that she came to was that her
three months’ journey on board the <span class='it'>Charon</span> would
be beset with many complications.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She made the very sensible resolve to avoid Ned’s
society and that of his two guests just as much as
possible. She saw at once they were not her kind
of people; and only unpleasantness would result
from her intercourse with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She couldn’t explain the darkening of her mood
that followed this resolve. Surely she did not lean
on these three for her happiness: the journey itself
offered enough in the way of adventure and pleasure.
She anticipated hours of enjoyment with
Knutsen, the Norse pilot and owner of the boat,
with McNab, the freckled, sandy-haired first engineer,
and with Forest, his young assistant. Yet
the weight of unhappiness that descended upon her
was only too real. She tried in vain to shake it off.
A sensible, self-mastered girl, she hated to yield to
an oppression that seemingly had its source in her
imagination only.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned had seemed so fine, so cheery, so companionable
the night he had taken her home, after the
accident. Yet he was showing himself a weakling:
she saw the signs of it too plainly to mistake. She
saw him not only on a far different social plane
from her own, but some way fallen in her respect.
He was separated from her not only by the unstable
barrier of caste but by the stone wall of standards.
She knew life, this girl of the world of toil, and she
seemed to know that all her half-glimpsed, intangible
dreams had come to nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And her decision to avoid the three aristocrats
stood her in good stead before the night was done,
saving her as bitter a moment as any that had oppressed
her in all the steep path of her life. Just
after the dinner call had sounded, Lenore, Ned, and
Mrs. Hardenworth had had a momentous conference
in the little dining saloon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The issue was silly and trivial from the first; but
even insignificant things assume dangerous proportions
when heady liquor is dying in the veins. It
had been too long since Mrs. Hardenworth had
had her drinks. She was in a doubtful mood,
querulous so far as her own assumption of good
breeding would permit, ready to haggle over nothing.
The three of them had come into the dining
room together: none of the other occupants of the
little schooner had yet put in an appearance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see the table’s set for four,” she began.
“Who’s the other place for—Captain Knutsen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid the captain has to mind his wheel.
This isn’t an oceanic liner. I suppose the place is
set for Miss Gilbert.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Watching the older woman’s face, Ned discerned
an almost imperceptible hardening of the lines that
stretched from the nose to the corners of the lips.
Likely he wouldn’t have observed it at all except
for the fact that he had now and then seen the same
thing in Lenore, always when she was displeased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Gilbert seems to fill the horizon. May I
ask how many more there are in the crew?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just McNab, Forest, and the cook. Both white
men take turns at the wheel in open water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s three for each table, considering one of
the men has to stay at the wheel. Why shouldn’t
one of these plates be removed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman spoke rather softly, but Ned did not
mistake the fact that she was wholly in earnest. “I
don’t see why not,” he answered rather feebly.
“Except, of course—they eat at irregular
hours——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen, Ned. Be sensible. When a seamstress
comes to our house she doesn’t eat at the table with
us. Not at your house either. Perhaps you’d say
that this was different, thrown together as we are
on this little boat, but I don’t see that it is different.
I hope you won’t mind my suggesting this thing to
you. I’ve handled servants all my life—I know
how to get along with them with the least degree of
friction—and it’s very easy to be <span class='it'>too</span> kind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned looked down, his manhood oozing out of
him. “But she’s a nice girl——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t doubt that she is,” Lenore interrupted
him. “That isn’t the point. It isn’t through any
attempt to assert superiority that mama is saying
what she is. You know we like to be alone, Ned;
we don’t want to have to include any one else in
our conversation. We’re a little trio here, and we
don’t need any one else. Tell the man to take away
her plate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, if you prefer it.” Half ashamed of
his reluctance, he called the negro and had the
fourth plate removed. “Miss Gilbert will eat at
the second table,” he explained. When the man had
gone, Ned turned in appeal to Lenore. “She’ll be
here in a minute. What shall I tell her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just what you told the servant—that she is
to wait for the second table. Ned, you might as
well make it clear in the beginning, otherwise it will
be a problem all through the trip. Wait till she
comes in, then tell her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned agreed, and they waited for the sound of
Bess’s step on the stair. Mrs. Hardenworth’s large
lips were set in a hard line: Lenore had a curious,
eager expectancy. Quietly Julius served the soup,
wondering at the ways of his superiors, the whites,
and the long seconds grew into the minutes. Still
they did not see Bess’s bright face at the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The soup cooled, and Mrs. Hardenworth began
to grow impatient. The girl was certainly late in
responding to the dinner call! And now, because
she was fully aroused, she was no longer willing to
accept that which would have constituted, a few
minutes before, a pleasant way out of the difficulty,—the
failure of the seamstress to put in an appearance.
The victorious foe, at white heat, demands
more than mere surrender. The two women, fully
determined as to Ned’s proper course, were not
willing the matter should rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Send for her,” Mrs. Hardenworth urged.
“There’s no reason you shouldn’t get this done and
out of the way to-night, so we won’t have to be distressed
about it again.” Her voice had a ring of
conviction; there was no doubt that, in her own
mind, she had fully justified this affront to Bess.
“You’ve got to face it some time. Tell the man to
ask her to come here—and then politely designate
her for the second table. She’s an employee of
yours, you are in real command of the boat, and
it’s entirely right and proper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wholly cowed, anxious to sustain the assumption
of caste that their words had inferred, he called to
the negro waiter. “Please tell Miss Gilbert to
come here,” he ordered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A wide grin cracking his cheeks, failing wholly
to understand the real situation and assuming that
“de boss” had relented in his purpose to exclude
the seamstress from the first table, the colored man
sped cheerfully away. Bess had already spoken
kindly to him; Julius had deplored the order to remove
her plate almost as a personal affront. And
he failed to hear Ned’s comment that might have revealed
the situation in its true light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you’re right,” he said weakly, after
Julius had gone. “But I feel like a cad, just the
same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again they waited for the seamstress to come.
The women were grim, forbidding. And in a moment
they heard steps at the threshold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But only Julius, his face beset with gloom, came
through the opened door. “De lady say she
’stremely sorry,” he pronounced, bowing. “But
she say she’s already promised Mista McNab to eat
with him!”</p>

<div><h1>VII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> <span class='it'>Charon</span> sped straight north, out of the
Sound, through the inside passage. Days were
bright; skies were clear, displaying at night a marvelous
intricacy of stars; the seas glittered from the
kindly September sun. They put in at Vancouver
the night following their departure from Seattle,
loaded on certain heavy stores, and continued their
way in the lea of Vancouver Island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Straight north, day after day! To McNab, a
man who had cruised ten years on Alaskan waters,
the air began to feel like home. It was crisp, surging
cool in the lungs, fragrant with balsam from
the wooded islands. Already Ned had begun to readjust
some of his ideas in regard to the North.
It was no longer easy to believe that his father had
exaggerated its beauty and its appeal, its desolation
and its vastness. It was a strange thing for a
man used to cities to go day upon day without seeing
scarcely a village beside the sea, a single human
being other than those of his own party. Here was
one place, it seemed, that the hand of man had
touched but lightly if at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The impression grew the farther north he went.
Ever there was less sign of habitation upon the
shore. The craft passed through narrow channels
between mountains that cropped up from the sea,
it skirted wooded islands, it passed forgotten Indian
villages where the totem poles stood naked
and weather-stained before the forsaken homes of
the chiefs. The glasses brought out a wonderland
scene just beyond the reach of their unaided sight,—glacier
and snow-slide, lofty peaks and water-falls.
The mystic, brooding spirit of the North
was already over them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had touched at Ketchikan, the port of
entry to Alaska, and thence headed almost straight
west, across the gulf of Alaska and toward the far-stretching
end of the Alaskan Peninsula. During
these days they were far out of sight of land, surrounded
only by an immeasurable ocean that rolled
endlessly for none to see or hear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were already far beyond the limits of ordinary
tourist travel. The big boats plied as far as
Anchorage at the head of Cook Inlet—to the north
and east of them now—but beyond that point the
traffic was largely that of occasional coastal traders,
most of them auxiliary schooners of varying respectability.
They seemed to have the ocean almost to
themselves, never to see the tip of a sail on the horizon,
or a fisherman’s craft scudding into port. And
the solitude crept into the spirits of the passengers
of the <span class='it'>Charon</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It became vaguely difficult to keep up a holiday
atmosphere. It was increasingly hard to be gay, to
fight down certain inner voices that had hitherto
been stifled. Some way, life didn’t seem quite the
same, quite the gay dream it had hitherto been.
And yet this immeasurable vista of desolate waters—icy
cold for all the sunlight that kissed the upreaching
lips of the waves—was some way like a
dream too. The brain kept clear enough, but it was
all somewhat confusing to an inner brain, a secret
self that they had scarcely been aware of before. It
was hard to say which was the more real,—the gay
life they had left, the laughter of which was still
an echo in their ears, or these far-stretching wastes
of wintry waters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They couldn’t help but be thoughtful. Realities
went home to them that they had no desire to admit.
A fervent belief in their own sophistication had been
their dominant point of view, a disillusionment and
a realism that was the tone of their generation, denying
all they could not see or hear, holding themselves
superciliously aloof from that gracious wonder
and simplicity that still blesses little children;
but here was something that was inscrutably beyond
them. They couldn’t laugh it away. They
couldn’t cast it off with a phrase of cheap slang; demeaning
it in order to hold firm to their own philosophy
of Self. Here was something that shook
their old attitude of self-love and self-sufficiency to
its foundations. They thought they knew life, these
three; they thought they were bigger than life, that
they had mastered it and found it out and stripped
all delusions from it, but now their unutterable conceit,
the pillar of their lives, was threatening to fall.
This sunlit sea was too big for them: too big and
too mighty and too old.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trouble with Ned’s generation was that it
was a godless generation: the same evil that razed
Babylon to the dust. Ned and his kind had come
to be sufficient unto themselves. They had lost
the wonder and fear of life, and that meant nothing
less than the loss of their wonder and fear of the
great Author of life. To these, life had been a
game that they thought they had mastered. They
had laughed to scorn the philosophies that a hundred
generations of nobler men had built up with
wondering reverence. Made arrogant by luxury
and ease, they knew of nothing too big for them,
no mystery that their contemptuous gaze could not
penetrate, no wonder that their reckless hands could
not unveil. They were drunk with their own
glories, and the ultimate Source of all things had
no place in their philosophies or their thoughts. It
was true that churches flourished among them, that
Charity received her due; but the old virile faith,
the reverent wonder, the mighty urge that has
achieved all things that have been worth achieving
were cold and dead in their hearts. But out here
in this little, wind-blown craft, surrounded by an
immensity of desolation beyond the power of their
minds to grasp, it was hard to hold to their old
complacency. Their old philosophies were barrenly
insufficient, and they couldn’t repel an ever deepening
sense of awe. The wind, sweeping over them
out of the vastness, was a new voice, striking the
laughter from their lips and instilling a coldness
that was almost fear in their warm, youthful blood.
The sun shone now, but soon vast areas, not far off,
would be locked tight with ice; never the movement
of a wave, never the flash of a sea-bird’s wing over
the wastes; and the thought sobered them and perhaps
humbled them a little too. Sometimes, alone
on the deck at night, Ned was close to the dearest
reality, the most profound discovery that could possibly
touch his life: that the dreadful spirit of God
moved upon the face of these desolate waters, no
less than, as is told in Genesis, at creation’s dawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everything would have been different if they had
come in a larger boat, for instance, one of the great
liners that plied between Seattle and Anchorage.
In that case, likely they would have had no trouble
in retaining their old point of view. The brooding
tone of the North would have passed them by; the
journey could still have remained a holiday instead
of the strange, wandering dream that it was. The
reason was simply that on a liner they would not
have broken all ties with their old life. There would
have been games and dancing, the service of menials,
social intercourse and all the superficialities
and pretenses that had until now composed their
lives. Their former standards, the attitudes from
which they regarded life, would have been unaltered.
There would have been no isolation, and thus
no darkening of their moods, no haunting uneasiness
that could not be named or described, no whispering
voices heard but dimly out of the sea. They
could have remained in their own old ramparts of
callousness and scorn. But here they were alone,—lost
and far on an empty sea, under an empty
sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was such a little group of them, only eight
in all. The ship was a mere dot in the expanse of
blue. Around them endlessly lay the sea, swept by
unknown winds, cursed by the winter’s cold, like
death itself in its infinity and its haunting fear.
The life they had left behind was already shadowed
and dim: the farewell shouts, the laughter, the
gaiety, the teeming crowds that moved and were
never still were all like something imagined, unspeakably
far off. Only the sea and the sky were
left, and the craft struggling wearily, ever farther
into the empty North.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lenore found herself oppressed by an unreasoning
fear. Realities were getting home to her, and she
was afraid of them. It would have been wiser not to
come, yet she couldn’t have told why. The launch
was wholly comfortable; she was already accustomed
to the cramped quarters. The men of the
crew were courteous, Ned the same devoted lover
as always. The thing was more an instinct with
her: such pleasure as the trip offered could not compensate
for an obscure uneasiness, a vague but
ominous shadow over her mood and heart that was
never lifted. Perhaps a wiser and secret self within
the girl, a subconsciousness which was wise with the
knowledge of the ages before ever her being
emerged from the germ plasm was even now warning
her to turn back. It knew her limitations; also
it knew the dreadful, savage realm she had dared
to penetrate. The North would have no mercy for
her if she were found unworthy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps in her heart she realized that she represented
all that was the antithesis of this far northern
domain. She was the child of luxury and ease: the
tone and spirit of these wintry seas were travail and
desolation. She was the product of a generation
that knew life only as a structure that men’s civilization
had built; out here was life itself, raw and
naked, stripped and bare. She was lawless, undisciplined,
knowing no code but her own desires;
all these seas and the gray fog-laden shores they
swept were in the iron grip of Law that went down
to the roots of time. She had never looked beyond
the surface of things; the heart that pulsed in the
breast of this wintry realm lay so deep that only
the most wise and old, devotees to nature’s secrets,
could ever hear it beat. She had the unmistakable
feeling that, in an unguarded moment, she had
blundered into the camp of an enemy. Ever she
discerned a malevolence in the murmur of the wind,
a veritable threat in the soft voices of the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The nights, her innate sense of artistry told her,
were unspeakably beautiful. She had never seen
such stars before. They were so large, so white,
and yet so unutterably aloof. Sometimes the moon
rose in a splash of silver, and its loveliness on the
far seas was a thing that words couldn’t reach.
Yet Lenore did not like things she could not put in
words. For all their beauty those magic nights dismayed
and disquieted her. They too were of the
realities, and for all her past attitude of sophistication,
she found that realism was the one thing she
could not and dared not accept. Such realities as
these, the wide-stretching seas and the infinity of
stars, were rapidly stripping her of her dearest delusions;
and with them, the very strongholds of her
being. Heretofore she had placed her faith in superficialities,
finding strength for her spirit and bolstering
up her self-respect with such things as pride
of ancestry, social position, a certain social attitude
of recklessness that she thought became her, and
most of all by refusing to believe that life contained
any depth that she had not plumbed, any terrors
that she dared not brave, any situation that she
could not meet and master. But here these things
mattered not at all. Neither ancestry nor social
position could save her should the winter cold,
hinted at already in the bitter frost of the dawns,
swoop down and find her unprotected. Her own
personal charm would not fight for her should she
fall overboard into the icy waters. Here was a
region where recklessness could very easily mean
death; and where life itself was suddenly revealed
utterly beyond her ken. But there was no turning
back. Every hour the <span class='it'>Charon</span> bore her farther from
her home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Hardenworth, whose habits of thought were
more firmly established, was only made irritable
and petulant by the new surroundings. Never
good company except under the stimulation of
some social gathering, she was rapidly becoming
something of a problem to Ned and Lenore. She
was irritable with the crew, on the constant verge
of insult to Bess, forecasting disaster for the entire
expedition. Unlike Bess, she had never been disciplined
to meet hardship and danger; her only resource
was guile and her only courage was recklessness;
so now she tried to overcome her inner fears
with a more reckless attitude toward life. It was
no longer necessary for Ned and Lenore to seek the
shelter of the pilot house for their third whisky-and-soda.
She was only too glad to take it with them.
More than once the dinner hour found her glassy-eyed
and almost hysterical, only a border removed
from actual drunkenness. Never possessing any
true moral strength or real good breeding, a certain
abandon began to appear in her speech. And they
had not yet rounded the Alaskan Peninsula into
Bering Sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Ned, the long north and westward journey
had been even more a revelation. He also knew
the fear, the disillusionment, a swift sense of weakness
when before he had been perfectly sure in his
own strength; but there was also a more complex
reaction,—one that he could not analyze or put
into words. He couldn’t call it happiness. It wasn’t
that, unless the mood that follows the hearing of
wonderful music is also happiness. Perhaps that
was the best comparison: the passion he felt was
something like the response made to great music.
There had been times at the opera, when all conditions
were exactly favorable, that he had felt the
same, and once when he had heard Fritz Kreisler
play Handel’s “Largo.” It was a strange reaching
and groping, rather than happiness. It was a
stir and thrill that touched the most secret chords of
his being.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt it most at night when the great, white
northern stars wheeled through the heavens. It
was good to see them undulled by smoke; they
touched some side of him that had never been stirred
into life before. At such times the sea was lost in
mystery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The truth was that Ned, by the will of the Red
Gods, was perceiving something of the real spirit
of the North. A sensitive man to start with, he
caught something of its mystery and wonder of
which, as yet, Lenore had no glimpse. And the
result was to bring him to the verge of a far-reaching
discovery: that of his own weakness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had never admitted weakness before. He
had always been so sure of himself, so complacent,
so self-sufficient. But curiously these things were
dying within him. He found himself doubting, for
the first time, the success of this northern adventure.
Could he cope with the realities that were beginning
to press upon him? Would not this northern wilderness
show him up as the weakling he was?</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the first time in his life Ned Cornet knew
what realism was. He supposed, in his city life,
that he had been a realist: instead he had only been
a sophist and a mocker in an environment that was
never real from dawn to darkness. He had read
books that he had acclaimed among his young
friends as masterpieces of realism—usually works
whose theme and purpose seemed to be a bald-faced
portrayal of sex—but now he saw that their very
premise was one of falsehood. Here were the true
realities,—unconquerable seas and starry skies and
winds from off the waste places.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unlike Lenore, Ned’s regrets were not that he
had ever launched forth upon the venture. Rather
he found himself regretting that he was not better
fitted to contend with it. Perhaps, after all, his
father had been right and he had been wrong. For
the first time in his life Ned felt the need of greater
strength, of stronger sinews.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What if his father had told the truth, and that
strict trials awaited him here. It was no longer
easy to disbelieve him. Almost any disaster could
fall upon him here, in these wastes of sunlit water,
in the very shadow of polar ice. The sun itself had
lost its warmth. It slanted down upon them from
far to the south, and it seemed to be beguiling them,
with its golden beauty on the waters, into some
deadly trap that had been set for them still farther
north. It left Ned some way apprehensive and
dismayed. He wished he hadn’t been so sure of
himself, that he had taken greater pains, in his
wasted years, to harden and train himself. Perhaps
he was to be weighed in the balance, and it was
increasingly hard to believe that he would not be
found wanting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In such a mood he recalled his father’s words regarding
that dread realm of test and trial that lay
somewhere beyond the world: “some bitter, dreadful
training camp for those that leave this world
unfitted to go on to a higher, better world.” He
had scorned the thought at first, but now he could
hardly get it out of his mind. It suggested some
sort of an analogy with his present condition.
These empty seas were playing tricks on his imagination;
he could conceive that the journey of which
his father had spoken might not be so greatly different
than this. There would be the same desolation,
the same nearness of the stars, the emptiness and
mystery, the same sense of gathering, impending
trial and stress. The name of the craft was the
<span class='it'>Charon</span>! The thought chilled him and dismayed
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For all his boasted realism, Ned Cornet had
never got away from superstition. Man is still not
far distant from the Cave and the Squatting Place,
and superstition is a specter from out the dead centuries
that haunts all his days. The coincidence
that their craft, plying through these deathly
waters, should bear such a name as the <span class='it'>Charon</span> suddenly
suggested a dark possibility to Ned. All at
once this man, heretofore so sure, so self-sufficient,
so incredulous of anything except his own continued
glory and happiness and life, was face to face
with the first fear—the simple, primitive fear of
death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Was that his fate at the journey’s end? Not
mere trial, mere hardship and stress and adventure,
but uncompromising death! Was he experiencing
a premonition? Was that training camp soon to
be a reality, as terribly real as these cold seas and
this sky of stars, instead of a mere figment of an
old man’s childish fancy?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thought troubled and haunted him, but it
proved to be the best possible influence for the man
himself. For the first time in his life Ned Cornet
was awake. He had been dreaming before: for the
first time he had wakened to <span class='it'>life</span>. Fear, disaster,
the dreadful omnipotence of fate were no longer
empty words to him: they were stern and immutable
realities. He knew what the wolf knows, when
he howls to the winter moon from the snow-swept
ridge: that he was a child in the hands of Powers so
vast and awful that the sublimest human thought
could not even reach to them! He could see, dimly
as yet but unmistakably, the shadow of that travail
that haunts men’s days from the beginning to the
end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His father’s blood, and in some degree his father’s
wisdom, was beginning to manifest itself in
him. It was only a whispered voice as yet, wholly
to be disregarded in the face of too great temptation,
yet nevertheless it was the finest and most
hopeful thing in his life. And it came particularly
clear one still, mysterious night, shortly after the
dinner hour, as he faced the North from the deck
of the <span class='it'>Charon</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The schooner’s auxiliary engines had pumped her
through Unimak Pass by now, the passage between
Unimak and Akun Islands, and now she had
launched forth into that wide, western portal of
the Arctic,—Bering Sea. Still the wonderful
succession of bright days had endured, no less than
marvelous, along the mist-swept southern shore of
the peninsula, but now the brisk, salty wind from
the northwest indicated an impending weather
change. It had been a remarkably clear and windless
day, and the night that had come down, so
swiftly and so soon, was of strange and stirring
beauty. The stars had an incredible luster; the
sea itself was of an unnamed purple, marvelously
deep,—such a color as scientists might find lying
beyond the spectrum. And Ned’s eyes, to-night,
were not dulled by the effects of strong drink.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For some reason that he himself could not satisfactorily
explain he hadn’t partaken of his usual
afternoon whiskies-and-sodas. He simply wasn’t
in a drinking mood, steadfastly refusing to partake.
Lenore, though she had never made it a point to
encourage Ned’s drinking habits, could not help but
regard the refusal as in some way a slight to herself,
and was correspondingly downcast and irritable.
Wholly out of sorts, she had let him go to
the deck alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The night’s beauty swept him, touching some
realm of his spirit deep and apart from his mere
love of pleasing visual image. His imagination
was keenly alive, and he had a distinct feeling that
the North had a surprise in store for him to-night.
Some stress and glory was impending: what he did
not know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Facing over the bow he suddenly perceived a
faint silver radiance close to the horizon. His first
impression was that the boat had taken a south-easternly
course, and this argent gleam was merely
the banner of the rising moon. Immediately he
knew better: except by the absolute disruption of
cosmic law, the moon could not rise for at least four
hours. He knew of no coast light anywhere in the
region, and it was hard to believe that he had caught
the far-off glimmer of a ship’s light. Seemingly
such followers of the sea had been left far behind
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as he watched the light grew. His own
pulse quickened. And presently a radiant streamer
burst straight upward like a rocket, fluttered a moment,
and died away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A strange thrill and stir moved through the intricacy
of his nerves. He knew now what this light
portended; it was known to every wayfarer in the
North, yet the keenest excitement took hold of him.
It moved him more than any painted art had ever
done, more than any wonderful maze of color and
light that a master stage director could effect. The
streamer shot up again, more brightly colored now,
and then a great ball of fire rolled into the sky, exploded
into a thousand flying fragments, and left a
sea of every hue in the spectrum in its wake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Northern Lights!” he told himself. A
quiver of exultation passed over him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There could be no mistake. This was the radiance,
the glory that the Red Gods reserve for those
who seek the far northern trails. Ever the display
increased in wonder and beauty. The streamers
were whisking in all directions now, meeting with
the effect of collision in the dome of the sky, remaining
there to shiver and gleam with incredible
beauty; the surging waves of light spread ever
farther until, at times, the sky was a fluttering
canopy of radiance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He thought of calling Lenore and Mrs. Hardenworth;
but some way the idea slipped out of his
mind. In a moment he was too deep in his own
mood even to remember that they existed. But not
only his exterior world faded from his consciousness.
For the moment he forgot <span class='it'>himself</span>; and with
it the old self-love and self-conceit that had pervaded
every moment of his past life, colored all his
views, and shaped the ends of his destiny. All that
was left was that incredible sky and its weird, reflected
glamor in the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was <span class='it'>Aurora Borealis</span>, never to be known, in
its full glory, to those that shun the silent spaces of
the North. Suddenly he felt glad that he was
here. The moment, by measure of some queer balance
beyond his sight, was worth all the rest of his
past life put together. Great trials might lie ahead,
temptations might tear him down, his own weakness
and folly of the past might lay him low in some
woeful disaster of the future; yet he was glad that
he had come! It was the most profound, the most
far-reaching moment of his life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Always he had lived close to and bound up in a
man-made civilization. In his heart he had worshipped
it, rather than the urge and the inspiration
that had made it possible: he had always judged the
Thing rather than the Source. But for the first
time in his life he was close to nature’s heart. He
had seen a glory, at nature’s whim, that transcended
the most glorious work of man ever beheld
in his native city. He was closer to redemption
than at any time in his life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few feet distant on the deck Bess’s eyes turned
from the miracle in the skies to watch the slowly
growing light in Ned Cornet’s face. It was well
enough for him to find his inspiration in the majesty
of nature. Bess was a woman, and that meant
that man that is born of woman was her work and
her being. She turned her eyes from God to behold
this man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And it was well for her that Lenore was not near
enough to see her face in the wan, ghostly radiance
of the Northern Lights. Her woman’s intuition
would have been quick to lay bare the secret of the
girl’s wildly leaping heart. Bess’s eyes were suddenly
lustrous with a light no less wonderful than
that which played in glory in the sky. Her face
was swiftly unutterably beautiful in its tenderness
and longing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And had she not fought against this very thing?
She had not dreamed for a moment but that she had
conquered and shut away the appeal that this man
made to her heart. It would have been easy enough
to conquer if he had only remained what he had
been,—selfish, reckless, self-loving, inured to his
tawdry philosophy of life. But to-night a new
strength had come into his face. Perhaps it would
be gone to-morrow, but to-night his manhood had
come to him. And she couldn’t resist it. It swept
her heart as the wind sweeps a sea-bird through the
sky.</p>

<div><h1>VIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Before</span> ever that long night was done, clouds had
overswept the sky and a cold rain was beating upon
the sea. It swept against the ports of the little
craft and brought troubled dreams to Lenore and
Mrs. Hardenworth. Bess, who knew life better
than these two, to whom the whole journey had been
a joyous adventure, did not wholly escape a feeling
of uneasiness and dismay. At this latitude and season
the weather was little to be trusted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The drizzle changed to snow that lay white on the
deck and hissed softly in the water. As yet, however,
it was nothing to fear. Snow was common
in these latitudes in September. The sudden break
of winter might lead to really serious consequences—perhaps
the unpleasant prospect of being ice-bound
in some island harbor—but in all probability
real winter was still several weeks distant. The
scene looked wintry enough to Lenore and Ned,
however. The air and the sky and the sea seemed
choked with snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lenore found herself wishing she had not been
so contemptuous of the North. Perhaps it would
have been better not to have taken so many worn-out
dresses to trade, but to have filled her chests
with woolens and furs. Even in her big coat she
couldn’t stay warm on the deck. The wind was icy
out of the Arctic seas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more the craft plied among islands; but
now that they had passed into Bering Sea the
character of the land had changed. These were
not the dull-green, wooded isles met with on first
entering Alaskan waters. Wild and inhospitable
though the latter had seemed, they were fairy
bowers compared to these. Nor did the mossy
mainland continue to show a marvelous beryl green
through mist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the first place, even the prevailing color
scheme had undergone an ominous change from
blue to gray. The sun kissed the sea no more:
under the sifting snow it stretched infinitely bleak
and forbidding. Gray were the clouds in the sky
that had been the purest, most serene blue. And
now even the islands had lost their varied tints.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Evergreen forests almost always look blue at a
distance,—bluish-green when the sun is bright,
bluish-black under clouds. But these voyagers
saw, with a dim, haunting dread, that the forests
mostly had been left far behind them. The islands
they passed now were no longer heavily wooded;
only a few of the sheltered valleys and the south
slopes of the hills bore thickets of stunted aspen,
birch, and Sitka spruce. Mostly these too were
gray, gray as granite, merely a different shade of
gray from that of the sea from which they rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The truth was that these islands were far-scattered
fragments of the Barrens, those great wastes
of moss and tundra between the timber belt and the
eternal ice cap of the pole. Largely treeless, wind-swept,
mostly unpeopled except for a few furtive
creatures of the wild, they seemed no part of the
world that Ned and Lenore had previously known.
They were all so gray, so bleak, swept with an unearthly
sadness, silent except for the weary beat of
waves upon their craggy shores.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mostly the islands were mere snow-swept mountains
protruding above the waters, at a distance
seemingly as gray as the rest of the toneless landscape.
Only the less mountainous of the islands
had human occupants, and these were in small, far-scattered
Indian villages. Seemingly they had
reached the dim, gray limits of the world: surely
they must soon turn back. Indeed, these were the
Skopins, the group that comprised Ned’s first trading
ground, and Muchinoff Island, the northern-most
land in the group and the point selected as his
first stopping place, from which he would begin the
long homeward journey from island to island, was
only a few days’ journey beyond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet they sped northward a while more, nothing
changing except day and night. Indeed, day and
night itself seemed no longer the unvarying reality
that it used to be. Between the dark clouds and
the dark sea, night never seemed to go completely
away. Day after day they caught no glimpse of
the sun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The islands were seen but dimly through mist, as
might the outlying shores of a Twilight Land, a
place where souls might come but never living men,—a
gray and eerie training camp like that of which
Ned’s father had spoken. It was all real enough,
truly, remorselessly real; yet Ned couldn’t escape
from the superstitious fear he had known at first.
The gray, desolate character of the islands seemed
to bear it out. It grew on him, rather than lessened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet his standards were changing. Things that
had not concerned him a few weeks before mattered
terribly now. For instance, the bareness of the
islands oppressed him, and he found himself longing
for the sight of trees. Just trees,—bending in
the wind, shaking off their leaves in the fall. They
hadn’t mattered before: he had regarded them as
mere ornaments that nature supplied for lawns and
parks, if indeed he had ever consciously regarded
them at all; but now they were ever so much more
important than a hundred things that had previously
seemed absolutely essential to his life and
happiness. Had his thought reached further, he
could have understood, now, the joy of Columbus—journeying
in waters scarcely less known than
these—at the sight of the floating branch; or the
exultation in the Ark when the dove returned with
its sprig of greenery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lately the ship had taken a northeastern turn,
following the island chain, and the cloudy, windy,
rainy days found them not far from the mainland,
in a region that would be wholly ice-bound in a few
weeks more. And when they were still a full day
from their turning point, Knutsen sought out Ned
on the deck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Cornet, do you know where we’re getting?”
he asked quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unconsciously startled by his tone, Ned whirled
toward him. “I don’t know these waters,” he replied.
“I suppose we’re approaching Muchinoff
Island.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite a sail between here and der, yet. Mr.
Cornet, we’re getting into de most unknown and
untraveled waters in all dis part of the Nort’.
De boats to Nome go way outside here, and de trut’
is I’m way out of my old haunts. I’m traveling by
chart only; neither me nor McNab, nor very many
oder people know very much the waterways between
dese islands. You’re up here to trade for
furs, and you haven’t got all winter. You know dat
dese waters here, shut off from the currents, are
going to be tighter dan a drum before very many
weeks. Why don’t you make your destination
Tzar Island, and start back from dere?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You think it’s really dangerous?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not really dangerous, maybe, but mighty awkward
if anyt’ing should go wrong wit’ de old brig.
You understan’ dat not one out of four of dese
little islands is inhabited. Some of de larger
islands have only a scattered village or two; some of
’em haven’t a living human being. Der’s plenty
and plenty of islands not even named in dis chart,
and I’d hate to hit the reefs of one after dark!
Der’s no one to send S. O. S. calls to, in case of
trouble, even if we had wireless. De only boat
I know dat works carefully through dis country is
anot’er trader, the <span class='it'>Intrepid</span>—and dat won’t be
along till spring. Mr. Cornet, it’s best for you to
know dat you’re in one of the most uninhabited
and barren countries——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the most dreary and generally damnable,”
Ned agreed with enthusiasm. “Why didn’t you
tell me this before? Muchinoff Island isn’t anything
in my young life. I picked it out as a starting
point simply because it was the farthest north
of the Skopins, but since there seems to be plenty
of territory——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will make you hump some to cover all de
good territory now, including some of the best of
de Aleuts, and get around Alaskan Peninsula
before winter sets in, in earnest. Tzar Island
is yust to our nort’east. Shall I head toward
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long will it take——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Depends on de wind. Dis is a ticklish stretch
of water in here, shallow in spots, but safe enough,
I guess. I think we can skim along and make it in
long before dawn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then do it!” Ned’s face suddenly brightened.
“The sooner I can shake my legs on shore, the better
I’ll like it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The seaman left him, and for a moment Ned
stood almost drunk with exultation on the deck.
Even now they were nearing the journey’s end. A
few hours more, and they could turn back from this
dreary, accursed wintry sea,—this gray, unpeopled
desolation that had chilled his heart. It was true
that the long journey home, broken by many stops,
still lay before, but at least he would face the south!
Once on his native shores, forever out of this twilight
land and away from its voice of reproach, he
could be content with his old standards, regain his
old self-confidence. He could take up his old life
where he had left it, forgetting these desolate wastes
as he would a dream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a fool ever to regret his wasted days!
He laughed at himself for ever giving an instant’s
thought to his father’s doleful words. The worst
of the journey was over, they had only to go back
the way they had come; and his puzzling sense of
weakness, his premonition of disaster, most of all
his superstitious fear of death had been the veriest
nonsense. His imagination had simply got out of
bounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old <span class='it'>Charon</span>! He had been afraid of her
name. Seemingly he had forgotten, for the time,
that he was a man of the twentieth century, the
product of the most wonderful civilization the world
had ever seen. He had been frightened by old
bogeys, maudlin with time-worn sentiments. And
now his old egotism had returned to him, seemingly
unshaken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently he turned, made his way into the hold,
and opened one of a pile of iron-bound wooden
cases. When he returned to the dining saloon he
carried a dark bottle in each hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All hands celebrate to-night!” he cried.
“We’re going to go home!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Out of the sea the wind seemed to answer him.
It swept by, laughing.</p>

<div><h1>IX</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Ned’s</span> news was received with the keenest delight
by Lenore and Mrs. Hardenworth. The latter regained
her lost amiability with promptness. Lenore’s
reaction was not dissimilar from Ned’s; in
her native city she could come into her own again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bottles were greeted with shouts of delight.
Ned went immediately to the sideboard and procured
half a dozen glasses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All hands partake to-night,” he explained.
“It’s going to be a <span class='it'>real</span> party.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He mixed whiskies-and-sodas for Lenore and
Mrs. Hardenworth; then started to make the
rounds of the crew with a bottle and glasses. He
did not, however, waste time offering any to Bess.
The latter had already evinced an innate fear of it,
wholly apart from sentimentality and nonsense.
She had lived in a circle and environment where
strong drink had not been merely a thing to jest
over and sing songs about, to drink lightly and receive
therefrom pleasant exhilaration; but where it
was a living demon, haunting and shadowing every
hour. She had no false sophistication—her
knowledge of life was all too real—and she had no
desire to toy with poison and play with fire. Both
were realities to her. She knew that they had
blasted life on life, all as sturdy and seemingly as
invincible as her own. Her abstinence was not a
moral issue with her. It was simply that she knew
here was a foe that met men in their pleasant hours,
greeted them in friendly ways, and then, by insidious,
slow attack, cast them down and left them
miserably to die; and she was simply afraid for her
life of it. Ned, on the other hand, would have
laughed at the thought of its ever mastering him.
He felt himself immune from the tragedies that had
afflicted other men. It was part of the conceit of
his generation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Ned found plenty of customers for his
whisky. McNab, at the wheel, wished him happy
days over two fingers of straight liquor in the glass,
and Knutsen, his pale eyes gleaming, poured himself
a staggering portion. “Go ahead,” Ned encouraged
him when the seaman apologized for his
greediness. “The sky’s the limit to-night.” And
Forest in the engine room, and Julius in the
kitchen absorbed a man’s-size drink with right good
will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned was able to make the rounds again before
the call for dinner; and the attitude of his guests
was changed in but one instance. McNab seemed
to be measuring his liquor with exceeding care. He
was a man who knew his own limits, and he apparently
did not intend to overstep them. He took a
small drink, but Knutsen, his superior, consumed as
big a portion as before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was an elated, spirited trio that sat down at
the little table in the saloon. Not one of them
could ever remember a happier mood. Julius
served the dinner with a flourish; and they had only
laughter when a sudden lurch of the craft slid the
sugar bowl off the table to the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, the ship’s drunk too,” Ned commented
gaily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were really in too glad a mood to see anything
but sport in the suddenly rocking table. The
truth was that the wind had suddenly sprung into a
brisk gale, rolling heavy seas and bobbing the little
craft about like a cork. The three screamed with
laughter, holding fast to their slipping chairs, and
Lenore rescued the bottle that was tipping precariously
on the buffet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’d better have a little extra one,” she told
them. “I’ll be seasick if we don’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had to speak rather loudly to make herself
heard. The wind was no longer laughing lightly
and happily at their port bows. It had suddenly
burst into a frantic roar, swelling to the proportions
of a thunder clap and dying away on
a long, weird wail that filled the sky and the
sea. Instantly it burst forth loudly again,
and the snow whipped against the glass of the
ports.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned stood up, braced himself, and immediately
poured the drinks. But it was not only to save
Lenore an attack of sea-sickness. He was also
swayed by the fact that the heat of the room seemed
to be swiftly escaping. Fortunately, there was still
warmth in plenty in the bottle, so he need not be
depressed by a mere fall of temperature. He
glanced about the room, rather suspecting that one
of the ports had been left open. The saloon, however,
was as tightly closed as was possible for it
to be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned at once, made his way through the
gale that swept the deck, and procured Lenore’s
and Mrs. Hardenworth’s heaviest coats. He noticed
as he passed that Bess had sought refuge in
the engine room. Ned waved to her then returned
to his guests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The room was already noticeably colder, not so
much from the drop in temperature—a thermometer
would have still registered above freezing—as
from the chilling, penetrating quality of the
wind that forced an entrance as if through the ship’s
seams. There seemed no pause, now, between the
mighty, roaring gusts. The long, weird wail they
had heard at first was only an overtone, in some way
oppressive to the imagination. The rattle at the
window was loud for the soft sweep of snow. Ned
saw why in a moment: the snow had changed to
sleet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no opportunity to make comment before
Knutsen lurched into the room. “It’s tough,
isn’t it?” he commented. “Mr. Cornet, I want another
shot of dat stuff before I take de wheel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned, not uninfluenced by his cups, extended the
bottle with a roar of laughter. “You know what’s
good for you,” he commented. “Where’s McNab?
Let him have one too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s still at de wheel, but I don’t think he’d
care for one. He’s a funny old wolf, at times.
Mrs. Hardenworth, how do you like dis weat’er?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t like it very well.” She held fast to the
slipping table. “Of course, you’d tell us if there
was any danger——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a bit of danger. Yust a squall. Dis isn’t
rough—you ought to see what it would be outside
dis chain of islands. But it’s mighty chilly.” He
poured the stiff drink down his great throat, then
buttoned his coat tight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned, for a moment secretly appalled by the
storm, felt his old recklessness returning. The captain
said it was only a squall,—and were they not
soon to turn south? In fact, their direction now
was no longer north, but rather in an easternly direction
toward Tzar Island. He was warm now,
glowing; the rocking of the boat only increased his
exhilaration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s only three or four shots left in this
bottle,” he said, holding up the second of the two
quarts he had taken from the case. “You’d better
have one more with us before you go. A man burns
up lots of whisky without hurting him any on a
night like this. Then take the bottle in with you
to keep you warm at the wheel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Knutsen needed no second urging. He was of a
race that yields easily to drink, and he wanted to
conquer the last, least little whisper of his fear of
the night and the storm. He drank once more,
pocketed the bottle, then made his way to the pilot
house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not going to try to ride her through?”
McNab asked, as he yielded the wheel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course. You’re not afraid of a little flurry
like dis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice gave no sign of the four powerful
drinks he had consumed. A tough man physically,
the truth was he was still a long way from actual
drunkenness. But even a small amount of liquor
had a distressing effect upon him,—a particularly
unfortunate effect for one who habitually has the
lives of other human beings in his charge. He always
lost the fine edge of his caution. With drink
upon him, he was willing to take a chance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>McNab stared into his glittering eyes, and for a
moment his lips were tightly compressed. “This
isn’t a little flurry,” he answered at last coldly.
“It’s a young gale, and God knows what it will be
by morning. You know and I know we shouldn’t
attempt things here that we can do with safety in
waters we’re familiar with. Right now we can run
into the lea of Ivan Island and find a harbor.
There’s a good one just south of the point.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re not going to run into Ivan Island. I
want to feel dry land. We’re going to head on
toward Tzar Island.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You run a little more of that bottle down your
neck and you’ll be heading us into hell. Listen,
Cap’n.” McNab paused, deeply troubled. “You
let me take the wheel, and you go in and celebrate
with the party. You won’t do any damage
then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you get back to your engine and mind your
own business.” Little angry points of light shot
into Knutsen’s eyes. “And if you see Cornet, tell
him to bring up anoder bottle. Dis one’s almost
empty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>McNab turned to the door, where for a moment
he stood listening to the wild raging of the wind.
Then he climbed down into the engine room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was nothing in his face, as he entered, to
reveal the paths of his thought. He was wholly
casual, wholly commonplace, seemingly not in the
least alarmed. He stepped to Bess’s side, half
smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder if you can help me?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl stood up, a straight, athletic figure at
his side. “I’ll try, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It depends—have you any influence with
young Cornet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bess slowly shook her head. “I’m afraid I can’t
help you,” she told him, very gravely. “I have no
influence with him at all. What is it you wanted
me to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wanted you to tell him to put up the booze.
Particularly to keep the captain from getting any
more. This is a bum night. It’s against the rules
of the sea to scare passengers, but somehow, I figure
you’re the stuff that can stand it and maybe hold
out. This isn’t a night to have a shipload of drunks.
There may be some tight places before the morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s only one way.” The girl’s lips were
close to his ear, else he couldn’t have heard in the
roar of the storm and the flapping of the sails.
“Listen, McNab. How much has he got in the
dining saloon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None, now, I don’t think. He only brought
up two bottles, and Knutsen’s got one of ’em—not
much in it, though. They must have emptied the
other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then we’re all clear.” She suddenly straightened,
a look of unswervable intent in her face.
“McNab, it’s better to make some one—violently
mad at you—isn’t it, if maybe you can save him
from trouble? If you want to see him get ahead
and make a success of a big venture—it isn’t
wrong, is it, to do something against his will that
you know is right?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>McNab looked at her as before now he had looked
at strong men with whom he had stood the watch.
“What are you gettin’ at?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice was gruff, but it didn’t offend her.
She felt that they were on common ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If may be human lives are the stake, a person
can’t stand by for one man’s anger,” she went on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Human lives are the first consideration,” the
man answered. “That’s the rule of the sea. Most
sea rules are good rules—built on sense—all except
the one that you can’t take the wheel away
from a drunken captain. What’s your idea?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know as well as I do. I promised his father
before I left that I’d look after Ned. He was
in earnest—and Ned needs looking after now if he
ever did. Mr. Cornet won’t blame me, either.
Show me how to get down in the hold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>McNab suddenly chuckled and patted her on the
back with rough familiarity, yet with fervent companionship.
“You’ve got the stuff,” he said.
“But you can’t lift them alone. I’m with you till
the last dog is hung.”</p>

<div><h1>X</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>On</span> the exposed deck the storm met the two adventurers
with a yell. For the first time Bess knew
its full fury, as the wind buffeted her, and the sleet
swept like fine shot into her face. They clung to
the railing, then fought their way to the hold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hidden by the darkness and the sleet, no one saw
them carry up the heavy liquor cases and drop them
into the sea. The noise of the storm concealed the
little sound they made. Finally only two bottles
remained, the last of a broken case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You take one of those and ditch it in your
room,” McNab advised. “I’ll keep the other.
There might come a time when we’ll find real need
for ’em—as a stimulant for some one who is freezing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take care of both of them,” Bess urged. “I’m
not sure I could keep mine, if any one asked for
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know about that. I believe I’d bet on
you. And now it’s done—forget about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon they crept back along the deck, McNab to
his work, Bess to her stateroom. The latter ignited
the lantern that served to light her room, and for a
moment stood staring into the little mirror that
hung above her washstand. She hadn’t escaped the
fear of the night and the storm and of the bold deed
she had just done. Her deep, blue eyes were wide,
her face was pale, the childlike appeal Ned had
noticed long ago was more pronounced than ever.
Presently she sat down to await developments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were not long in coming. She and McNab
had all but encountered Ned on his way to the hold.
His bottles were empty, and the desire for strong
drink had not left him yet. In the darkness under
the deck he groped blindly for his cases.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They seemed to evade him. Breathing hard, he
sought a match, scratching it against the wall.
Then he stared in dumb and incredulous astonishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His stock of liquor was gone. Not even the
cases were left. Thinking that perhaps some shift
in the position of the stores had concealed them, he
made a moment’s frantic search through the hold.
Then, raging like a child, and in imminent danger
of slipping on the perilous deck, he rushed to the
pilot house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Captain, do you know what became of my
liquors?” he demanded. “I can’t find them in the
hold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The binnacle light revealed the frenzy and desperation
on his drawn face; the mouth was no longer
smiling its crooked, boyish smile. Knutsen glanced
at him once, then turned his eyes once more over his
wheel. For the moment he did not seem to be
aware of Ned’s presence. He made, however, one
significant motion: his brown hand reached out to
the bottle beside him, in which perhaps two good
drinks remained, and softly set it among the shadows
at his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say!” Ned urged. “I tell you my liquor’s
gone!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The captain seemed to be studying the yellow
path that his searchlight cut in the darkness. The
waves were white-capped and raging; the sleet
swept out of the gloom, gleamed a moment in the
yellow radiance, then sped on into the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I heard you,” Knutsen answered slowly. “I
was thinking about it. I haven’t any idea who took
it—if he’s still got it, I’ll see that he gives it back.
It was a dirty trick——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t know, then, anything about it?”
As he waited, Ned got the unmistakable idea that
the captain neither knew nor really cared. He was
more interested in retaining the two remaining
drinks in his own bottle than in helping Ned regain
his lost cases. These two were enough for him. It
was wholly in keeping with that strange psychology
of drunkards that he should have no further
cares.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I don’t know anything about ’em—but
I’ll help you investigate in the morning,” he answered.
“I’m very sorry, Mr. Cornet—that it
should happen aboard my ship——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To hell with your ship! I’m going to investigate
to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned started out, but he halted in the doorway,
arrested by a sudden suspicion. Presently he
whirled and made his way to Bess’s stateroom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knocked sharply on the door. Bess opened it
wide. Then for a long second he stared into her
deep-blue, appealing eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you did it?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She nodded. “I did it—to save you—from
yourself. Not to mention perhaps saving the ship
as well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His lip drew up in scorn. Angry almost to the
verge of childish tears, he could not at first trust
himself to speak. “You’ve certainly taken things
into your own hands,” he told her bitterly. His
wrath gathered, breaking from him at last in a
flood. “You ill-bred prude, I wish I could never
lay eyes on you again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His scornful eyes saw the pain well into her face.
Evidently he had gone the limit: he couldn’t have
hurt her worse with a blow of his hand. Touched a
little in spite of himself, he began to feel the first
prick of remorse. Perhaps it had done no good to
speak so cruelly. Certainly the whiskies could not
be regained. Probably the fool thought she was
acting for his own good. He turned, slammed the
door, and strode back to the dining saloon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was by far the most bitter moment in Bess’s
life. She had done right, but her payment was a
curse from the man she had hoped to serve. All
her castles had fallen: her dreams had broken like
the bubbles they were. This was the answer to the
calling in her heart and the longing in her soul,—the
spoken wish that she might pass from his sight
forever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the last few days, since they had entered this
strange, snowy, twilight region, she had had dreams
such as she had never dared admit into her heart
before. Anything could happen up here. No
wonder was too great. It was the kind of place
where men found themselves, where all things were
in proper balance, and false standards fell away.
Some way, she had been on the lookout for a miracle.
But the things which had been proven false,
which could not live in this bitter world of realities,
were her own dreams! They had been the only
things that had died. She had been a fool to hope
that here, at the wintry edge of the world, she might
find the happiness she had missed in her native city.
The world was with her yet, crushing her hopes as
its rocky crust crushes the fallen nestling before it
learns to fly!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But at his post McNab had already forgotten the
episode of the liquor cases. Indeed, he had forgotten
many other matters of much greater moment.
At the present his mind was wholly occupied by two
stern realities,—one of them being that the storm
still raged in unabated fury, and the other that a
drunken captain was driving his craft at a breakneck
speed over practically uncharted waters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The danger lay not only in the fact that Knutsen
had disregarded McNab’s good advice to seek shelter
in one of the island harbors. Even now he was
disregarding the way of comparative safety, was
not pausing to take soundings, but was racing along
before the wind instead of heading into it with the
power of the auxiliary engines. With wind and
wave hurling her forward, there would be no
chance to turn back or avoid any island reef that
might suddenly loom in their path. Knutsen was
trusting to his sea gods over waters he had never
sailed before, torn by storms and lighted only by a
feeble searchlight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more McNab lifted his head through the
hatch into the pilot house; and for long seconds he
studied intently the flushed face over the wheel.
They hadn’t really helped matters, so far as Knutsen
was concerned, by throwing the cases overboard.
Seemingly his watch would be over before the
fumes of the liquor he had already consumed died
in his brain. At present he was in its full flush:
wholly reckless, obstinate, uncertain of temper.
Was there any possible good in appealing to him
further?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What now?” Knutsen asked gruffly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve forgotten all the seamanship you ever
knew,” McNab returned angrily. “There’s no
hurry about reaching Tzar Island. And you’re
risking every body’s life on board, sailing the way
you are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you captain of dis boat?” Knutsen demanded
angrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Den get out of here. I know exactly what
I’m doing. You’re just as safe as——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it came about that Captain Knutsen did not
finish the sentence. McNab was never to find out,
from Knutsen’s lips, just how safe he was. All at
once he cried sharply in warning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before ever Knutsen heard that sharp cry, he
knew what lay ahead. Dulled though his vision
was, slow the processes of his brain, he saw that
curious ridge of white foam in front,—an inoffensive-looking
trail of white across their bows. At the
same instant his keen ears caught a new sound, one
that was only half-revealed in the roar and beat of
the storm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was not the pause of an instant before his
great, muscular arms made response. At the same
instant Forest tried to apply the power of his engines
in obedience to the sharp gong from above.
And then both Knutsen and McNab braced themselves
for the shock they knew would come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The craft seemed to leap in the water, shuddered
like a living thing, and the swath of the searchlight
described a long arc into the sleet and the storm.
It may have been that Knutsen shouted again—a
meaningless sound that was lost quickly in the wind—but
for seconds that seemed to drag into interminable
centuries he sat absolutely without outward
sign of motion. His great hands clutched his
wheel, the muscles were set and bunched, but it was
as if the man had died and was frozen rigid in an
instant of incredible tension. His face utterly
without expression, Forest crouched beside his
engines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was nothing that either of them could do.
The waves and wind were a power no man could
stay. All their efforts were as useless as Knutsen’s
shout; already the little ship was in the remorseless
grasp of a great billow that was hurling her toward
the ridge of white foam in front. For another instant
she seemed to hang suspended, as if suddenly
taken wing, and then there was a sheer drop, a sense
of falling out of the world. A queer ripping, tearing
sound, not loud at all, not half so terrifying as
the bluster of the wind, reached them from the hold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cold sober, Knutsen turned in his place and
gonged down certain orders to Forest. In scarcely
a moment, it seemed, they were pulling the battens
from the two little lifeboats on the deck.</p>

<div><h1>XI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Knutsen’s</span> brain was entirely clear and sure as
he gave his orders on the deck. His hand was
steady as iron. His failure to master himself had
brought disaster, but he knew how to master a ship
at a time like this. From the instant the <span class='it'>Charon</span>
had struck the reef, he was the power upon that
storm-swept deck, and whatever hope McNab had
lay in him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the lantern light, blasted by the wind and in
the midst of the surging waves, the scene had little
semblance to reality. It was a mad dream from
first to last, never to be clearly remembered by the
survivors: a queer, confused jumble of vivid images
that could never be straightened out. The head-light
still threw its glare into the sleet-filled night.
The biting, chill wind swept over the deck and into
the darkness. The ship settled down like a leaden
weight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Almost at once the four passengers were on deck,
waiting to take their meager chance in the lifeboats.
The stress, the raging elements, those angry seas
that ever leaped higher and nearer, as if coveting
their mortal lives, most of all the terror such as had
never previously touched them, affected no two of
them alike. Of the three women, Bess alone moved
forward, out of the shelter of the cabin, to be of
what aid she could. Her drawn, white face was
oddly childlike in the lantern light. Mrs. Hardenworth
had been stricken and silenced by the nearing
visage of death; Lenore, almost unconscious with
terror, made strangling, sobbing sounds that the
wind carried away. And in this moment of infinite
travail Ned Cornet felt his manhood stirring within
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps it was merely instinct. It is true that
men of the most abandoned kind often show startling
courage and nobility in a crisis. The reason
is simply that the innate virtue of the race, a light
and a glory that were implanted in the soul when the
body was made in the image of its Maker, comes to
the surface and supersedes the base impulses of degeneracy.
There is no uneven distribution of that
virtue: it is as much a part of man as his hands or
his skull; and the difference between one man and
another lies only in the degree in which it is developed
and made manifest and put in control over the
daily life. Perhaps the strength that rose in Ned
was merely the assertion of an inner manhood,
wholly stripped of the traits that made him the individual
he was,—nothing that would endure,
nothing that portended a change and growth of
character. But at least the best and strongest side
of him was in the ascendency to-night. The danger
left him cool rather than cost him his self-control.
The seeming imminence of death steadied
him and nerved him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bess saw him under the lantern light, and he was
not the man who had cursed her at the door of her
room. For the moment all things were forgotten
except this. Likely the thing he had spoken would
come true, now. Perhaps he would get his wish.
For one interminable instant in which her heart
halted in her breast—as in death—sea and wind
and storm ceased to matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned came up, and Knutsen’s cold gaze leaped
over his face. “Help me here,” he commanded.
“McNab, you help Forest and Julius launch the
larger boat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was not much launching to do. Waves
were already bursting over the deck. Knutsen
turned once more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We want four people in each boat,” he directed
sharply. “Cornet, you and I and Miss Hardenworth
in this one. The other girl will have to get
in here too. The other boat’s slightly larger—Mrs.
Hardenworth, get in with McNab, Forest,
and Julius.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bess shook herself with difficulty from her revery.
This was no time for personal issues, to
hearken to the voices of her inmost heart when the
captain was shouting through the storm. The only
issues remaining now were those of deliverance or
disaster, life or death. Even now the white hands
of the waves were stretching toward her. Yet this
terrible reality did not hold her as it should. Instead,
her thoughts still centered upon Ned: the
danger was always Ned’s instead of her own; it was
Ned’s life that was suspended by a thread above the
abyss. It was hard to remember herself: the instinct
of self-preservation was not even now in the
ascendency.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is a blasting and primitive terror in any
great convulsion of the elements. These are man’s
one reality, the eternal constant in which he plights
his faith in a world of bewildering change: the air
of heaven, the sky of stars, the unutterable expanse
of sea. His spirit can not endure to see them in
tumult, broken forth from the restraint of law.
Such sights recall from the germ-plasm those first
almighty terrors that were the title page of conscious
life; and they disrupt quickly the mastery
that mind, in a thousand-thousand years, has gained
over instinct. Yet for herself Bess was carried out
from and beyond the terror of the storm. She had
almost forgotten it: it seemed already part of the
natural system in which she moved. She was
scarcely aware that the captain had shouted to make
himself heard; that she must needs shout to answer
him: it was as if this were her natural tone of voice,
and she was no more conscious of raising it above
the bellow of the storm than are certain fisherfolk,
habitants of wave-swept coasts, when they call one
to another while working about their nets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reason was simply that she was thinking too
hard about Ned to remember her own danger, and
thus terror could not reach her. It can never curse
and blast those who have renounced self for others;
and thus, perhaps, she had blundered into that great
secret of happiness that wise men have tried to teach
since the world was new. Perhaps, in the midst of
stress and travail, she had glimpsed for an instant
the very soul of life, the star that is the hope and
dream of mankind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But while she had forgotten her own danger, she
was all too aware of the promptings of her own
heart. The issue went farther than Ned’s life. It
penetrated, in secret ways, the most intimate depths
of her relations with him. It was natural at such
a time that she should remember Ned’s danger to
the exclusion of her own. The strangeness of that
moment lay in the fact that she also remembered his
wishes and his words. She could not forget their
last scene together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Put Mrs. Hardenworth in your boat, so she and
Lenore can be together,” she told Captain Knutsen.
“I’ll get in the other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The captain did not seem to hear. He continued
to shout his orders. In the work of lowering the
lifeboat he had cause to lift his lantern high, and for
a moment its yellow gleam was bright upon Bess’s
drawn, haggard face. Farther off it revealed Ned,
white-faced but erect in the beat of the storm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In one instant’s insight, a single glimpse between
the storm and the sea, he understood that she was
taking him at his word. For some reason beyond
his ken—likely beyond hers, too—she had asked
to be put in McNab’s boat so that his wish he had
spoken in anger at the door of her stateroom might
come true. How silly, how trivial he had been!
Those angry words had not come from his heart:
only from some false, superficial side of him that
was dying in the storm. He had never dreamed
that she would take them seriously. They were the
mere spume of a child that had not yet learned to be
a man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get in with us,” he said shortly. “Don’t be
silly—as I was.” Then, lest she should mistake
his sentiment: “Mrs. Hardenworth is twice your
weight, and this boat will be overloaded as it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl looked at him quietly, nodding her head.
If he had expected gratitude he was disappointed,
for she received the invitation as merely an actuality
of her own, immutable destiny. Indeed the wings
of destiny were sweeping her forward, her life still
intertwined with his, both pawns in the vast, inscrutable
movement of events.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He helped her into the dory. Julius, who at the
captain’s orders had been rifling the cabins, threw
blankets to her. Then tenderly, lending her his
strength, Ned helped Lenore over the wind-swept
deck into the bow seat of the lifeboat, nearest to the
seat he would take himself. “Buck up, my girl,”
he told her, a deep, throbbing note in his voice.
“I’ll look after you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Already the deck was deserted. The dim light
showed that the larger dory, containing McNab,
Forest, Julius, and Mrs. Hardenworth, had already
been launched. There was no sign of them now.
The darkness and the storm had already dropped
between. They could not hear a shout of directions
between the three men, not a scream of fear from
the terrified woman who was their charge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was as if they had never been. Only the
<span class='it'>Charon</span> was left—her decks awash and soon to dive
and vanish beneath the waves—and their little
group in the dim gleam of the lantern. Knutsen
and Ned took their places at the oarlocks, Ned
nearer the bow, Knutsen just behind. A great
wave seemed to catch them and hurl them away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Could they live in this little boat on these tumultuous
seas? Of course the storm was nothing compared
to the tempests weathered successfully by
larger lifeboats, but it held the utmost peril here.
Any moment might see them overwhelmed. The
least of those great waves, catching them just right,
might overturn them in an instant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Already the <span class='it'>Charon</span> was lost in the darkness, just
as the other lifeboat had been lost an instant before.
Not even Knutsen could tell in what direction she
lay. Still the waves hurried them along. The
chill wind shrieked over them, raging that they
should have dared to venture into its desolate domains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Could they live until the morning? Wouldn’t
cold and exposure make an end to them in the long,
bitter hours to come? The odds looked so uneven,
the chances so bitterly long against them. Could
their little sparks of being, the breath of life that
ever was so wan and feeble, the little, wondering
moment of self-knowledge that at best seemed only
the fabric of a dream—could these prevail against
the vast, unspeakable forces of the North?
Wouldn’t the spark go out in a little while, the
breath be blown away on the wings of the wind, the
self-light burn down in the gloom? At any moment
their fragile boat might strike another submerged
reef. There was no light to guide them
now. They were lost and alone in an empty ocean,
helpless prey to the whims of the North.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pillars of their strength had fallen. Man’s
civilization that had been their god was suddenly
shown as an empty idol, helpless to aid them now.
The light, the beauty, the strong cities they had
loved had no influence here: seemingly death itself
could not make these things farther distant, less
availing. For the first time since they were born
Ned and Lenore were face to face with <span class='it'>life</span>, and
also with the death that shadows life. For the first
time they knew the abject terror of utter helplessness.
There was nothing they could do. They
were impotent prey to whatever fate awaited them.
Captain Knutsen, mighty of frame, his blood surging
fiercely through the avenues of his veins, and
Bess, schooled to hardship, were ever so much better
off than they. They were better disciplined,
stronger in misfortune, better qualified to meet danger
and disaster. For no other reason than that—holding
respect for these northern seas—they were
more warmly dressed, their chances were better for
ultimate survival.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But what awaited them when the night was done?
How slight was the chance that, in this world of
gray waters, they would ever encounter an inhabited
island. It was true that islands surrounded
them on all sides, but mostly they were but wastes
of wind-swept tundra, not one in four having human
habitations. Mostly the islands were large,
and such habitations as there might be were scattered
in sheltered valleys along the shore, and it was
wholly probable that the little boat could pass and
miss them entirely. They couldn’t survive many
days on these wintry waters. The meager supplies
of food and the jugs of water in the lifeboats would
soon be exhausted, and who could come to their aid?
Which one of Ned’s friends, wishing him such a
joyous farewell at the docks, would ever pause in
his play one moment to investigate his fate?</p>

<p class='pindent'>A joy-ride! There was a savage irony in the
thought of the holiday spirit with which he had
undertaken the expedition. And the voices he had
heard out of the sea had evidently told him true
when they had foretold his own death. For all his
natural optimism, the odds against him seemed too
great ever to overcome. And there was but one
redeeming thought,—a thought so dimly discerned
in the secret mind of the man that it never fully
reached his conscious self; so bizarre and strange
that he could only attribute it to incipient delirium.
It was simply that he had already fortified himself,
in some degree, to meet the training camp thereafter!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The journey through the gray, mysterious seas,
the nearing heart of nature, most of all to-night’s
disaster had, in some small measure, given him
added strength. It was true that his old conceit
was dying in his body. His old sense of mastery
over himself and over life was shown as a bitter delusion:
rather he was revealed as the helpless prey
of forces beyond even his power to name. This
self-centered man, who once had looked on life from
the seats of the scornful, felt suddenly incompetent
even to know the forces that had broken him down.
Yet in spite of all this loss, there was something
gained. Instead of false conceit he began to sense
the beginnings of real self-mastery. For all his
terror, freezing his heart in his breast, he suddenly
saw clear; and he knew he had taken an upward
step toward Life and Light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There would not be quite so long a course of
training for him, in the Hereafter. He could go
through and on more quickly on account of these
past days. There <span class='it'>was</span> a way through and out—his
father had told him that—and it wasn’t so far
distant as when he had first left home. With death
so close that he could see into its cavernous eyes,
such was Ned’s one consolation as the craft drifted
before the wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The terror that was upon him lifted, just an instant,
as he bent to hear what Lenore was trying
to tell him. Lenore was his love and his life, the
girl to whom he had plighted his troth, and his first
obligation was to her. He must see to her first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m cold,” she was sobbing. “I’m freezing to
death. Oh, Ned, I’m freezing to death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course it wasn’t true. Chill though the night
was, the temperature was still above freezing, and
the blankets about her largely protected her from
the biting winds. She was chilled through, however,
as were the other three occupants of the craft;
and the fear and the darkness were themselves like
ice in her veins. Ned’s hands were stiff, but he managed
to remove one of his own blankets and wrap it
about the shoulders of the girl. The boat lurched
forward, sped by the waves and the wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The night hours passed over the face of the sea.
The wind raged through the sky, biting and bitter
for all their warm wraps. It was abating, now, the
waves were less high; but if anything its breath
was more chill as the hour drew toward dawn. The
wind-blown sleet swept into their faces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both girls sought refuge in troubled sleep. Ned
sat with his arms about Lenore, giving her what
warmth he could from his own body. Bess was huddled
in her seat. Could their less rugged constitutions
stand many hours of such cold and exposure?
It was a losing game, already. The North
was too much for them. Life is a fragile thing at
best: a few hours more might easily spell the end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But that hour saw the return of an ancient mystery,
carrying back the soul to those gray days
when the earth was without form, and void. Darkness
had been upon the face of the waters, but once
more it was divided from the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even here, seemingly at the edge of the world,
the ancient miracle did not fail. A grayness, like
a mist, spread slowly; and the curtains of darkness
slowly receded. The storm was abating swiftly
now; and the dawn broke over an easily rolling sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Knutsen, who had sat so long in one
position—his gaze fastened on one point of the
horizon—that he gave the impression of being unconscious,
suddenly started and pointed his hand.
His voice, pitched to the noise of the storm, roared
out into the quiet dawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Land!” he shouted. “We’re coming to land!”</p>

<div><h1>XII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>None</span> of the other three in the lifeboat could
make out the little, gray line on the horizon that
Captain Knutsen identified as land. Ned, who had
been wide awake, prayed that he was not mistaken,
yet could not find it in his heart to believe him.
Bess and Lenore both started out of their sleep,
and the former turned her head wearily, a wan
smile about her drawn lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Row, man, row!” Knutsen called happily to
Ned. “The only way we can save that girl from
collapse is to get her to a fire.” His own oars
dipped, and his powerful back bent to the task.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the issue had got down to that! Ned knew
perfectly well that Lenore was the girl meant; in
spite of the added blanket, she had fared worse than
Bess. Perhaps she had less vitality: perhaps she
had not met the night’s adversity with the same
spirit. Ned was not an expert oarsman, but it was
ever to his credit that he gave all his strength to
the oars. And he found to his joy that the night’s
adventure had left it largely unimpaired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the waves and the wind behind them, Knutsen
saw the gray line that was the island slowly
strengthen. The time came at last, when his weaker
arms were shot through with burning pain, that
Ned could also make it out. It was still weary
miles away. And there was still the dreadful probability—three
chances out of four—that it was
uninhabited by human beings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And death would find them quickly enough if
they failed to find human habitations. For all
Knutsen’s prowess, for all that he was so obviously
a man of his hands, Ned couldn’t see any possibility
of sustaining life on one of the barren, wind-swept
deserts for more than a few days at most.
They had no guns to procure meat from the wild:
their little stores of food would not last long. The
cold itself, though not now severe, would likely
master them quickly. Even if they could find fuel,
they had no axe to cut it up for a fire. In all probability,
they couldn’t even build a fire in the snow
and the sleet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stabbing pain in his arms was ever harder
to bear. He was paying the price for his long
pampering of his muscles. The time soon came
when he had to change his stroke, dipping the oars
at a cheating angle. Even if it were a matter of
life and death to Lenore he couldn’t hold up. He
couldn’t stand the pace. Knutsen, however, still
rowed untiringly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon the island began to take shape, revealing
itself as of medium size in comparison with many
of the islands of Bering Sea, yet seemingly large
enough to support a kingdom. The gray line they
had seen first revealed itself as a low range of
mountains, bare and wind-swept, extending the full
length of the island. What timber there was—meager
growths of Sitka spruce and quivering
aspen—appeared only on some of the south slopes
of the hills and in scattered patches on the valley
floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the gray light of dawn the whole expanse was
one of unutterable desolation. Even the rapture
that they had felt at deliverance from the sea was
some way stifled and dulled in the brooding despair
that seemed to be its very spirit. They had passed
many bleak, windy islands on the journey; but none
but what were gardens compared to this. Ned tried
to rouse himself from a strange apathy, a sudden,
infinite hopelessness that fell like a shadow over
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Likely enough it was just a mood with him,
nothing innate in the island itself. Probably his
own fatigue was playing tricks on his imagination.
Yet the solid earth seemed no longer familiar. It
was as if he had passed beyond his familiar world,
known to his five senses and firm beneath his feet,
and had come to an eerie, twilight land beyond
the horizon. It was so still, lying so bleak and gray
in the midst of these endless waters, seemingly so
eternally isolated from all he had known and seen.
The physical characteristics of the island enhanced,
if anything, its mysterious atmosphere. The mossy
barrens that comprised most of the island floor, the
little, scattered clumps of timber, the deep valleys
through which the shining streams ran to the sea,
the rugged, shapeless hills beyond, each real in itself,
combined to convey an image of unreality.
Over it all lay the snow. The whole land was swept
with it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was evidently the kingdom of the wild. It
was the home of caribou and bear, fox and wolverine
rather than men. And the dreadful probability
was ever more manifest that the island contained
not a single hearth, a single Indian igloo in which
they might find shelter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The place seemed to be utterly uninhabited by
human beings. The white shore was nearing now,
the craft had reached the mouth of a large harbor
formed by the emptying waters of a small river;
and as yet the voyagers could not make out a single
roof, a single canoe on the shore. Knutsen peered
with straining eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It looks bad,” he said tonelessly. “If there was
a village here it ought to be located at the mouth
of that river. It’s the logical place for a camp.
They always stay near the salmon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Straining, Ned suddenly saw what seemed to him
a manifestation of human inhabitants. There were
clearly pronounced tracks, showing dark against
the otherwise unbroken snow, leading from the sea
to a patch of heavy forest a quarter of a mile back
on the island. He pointed to them, his eye kindling
with renewed hope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Knutsen shook his head. “I can’t tell from
here. They might be animal tracks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The canoe pushed farther into the harbor. The
roll of the waves was ever less, and the boat rode
evenly on almost quiet water. They would know
soon now. They would either find safety, or else
their last, little hope would go the way of all the
others. Surely they could not live a day unaided
in this bleak, desolate land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But at that instant Bess, who had sat so quiet
that her companions had thought her asleep, uttered
a low cry. For all its subdued tone, its living
note of hope and amazement caused both men to
turn to her. Her white face was lifted, her blue
eyes shining, and she was pointing to the fringe of
timber at the end of the trail in the snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” she asked in a low tone. “Isn’t
it a man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her keen eyes had beheld what Knutsen’s had
missed—a dark form half in shadow against the
edge of the scrub timber. For all that it was less
than a quarter of a mile distant, both men had to
strain to make it out. The explanation lay partly
in the depths of the surrounding shadows; partly
in the fact that the form was absolutely without
motion. It is an undeniable fact that only moving
figures are quickly discernible in the light and
shadow of the wild places: thus the forest creatures
find their refuge from their enemies simply by
standing still and so remaining unobserved. The
thing at the timber edge had evidently learned this
lesson. In its dimness and obscurity it suggested
some furtive creature native to the woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet, for all its lack of motion, this was unmistakably
a living being. It was not just an odd-shaped
stump, a dark shadow under tree limbs such
as so often misleads a big-game hunter. The brain
seemed to know it, without further verification by
the senses. Bess had said it was the form of a
man, and the more intent their gaze, the more probable
it seemed that she was right. The fear that
had oppressed Knutsen that it might be merely the
form of some one of the larger forest creatures—perhaps
a bear, standing erect, or a caribou facing
them—was evidently groundless. It was a man,
and he was plainly standing motionless, fully aware
of and watching their approach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet the atmosphere of vagueness prevailed. He
was so like a woods creature in the instinctive way
he had taken advantage of the concealment of the
shadows. It was a wonder that Bess had ever observed
him. And now, drawing closer, his proportions
seemed to be considerably larger than is customary
in the human species. Now that his outline
grew plain, he loomed like a giant. There is nothing
so deceptive, however, as the size of an object
seen at a distance in the wilderness. The degree
of light, the clearness of the atmosphere, the nature
of the background and surroundings all have their
effect: often a snow-hare looks as big as a fox or a
porcupine as large as a bear. Ned, sharing none
of Knutsen’s inner sense of unrest, yielding at last
to the rapture of impending deliverance, raised his
arms and shouted across the waters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to be sure he sees us,” he explained
quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Knutsen strove to rid himself of the unwonted
dismay that took hold of him. A deep-buried subconsciousness
had suddenly manifested itself within
him, but the messages it conveyed were proven
ridiculous by his own good sense. It was the first
time, however, that this inner voice had ever led
him astray. Surely this was deliverance, life instead
of what had seemed certain death, yet he was
oppressed and baffled as he had never been in his
life before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was soon made plain that the man had caught
Ned’s signal. He lifted his arm, then came walking
down toward the water’s edge. Then Knutsen,
who until now had rowed steadily, paused with his
paddles poised in the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not an Indian,” he breathed quickly. Ned
turned to look at him in amazement, yet not
knowing at what he was amazed. “It’s a white
man!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t that all the better?” Ned demanded.
“God knows I’m glad to see any kind of a man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After all, wasn’t that good sense? Trapping,
fox-farming, any one of a dozen undertakings
took white men into these northern realms. Conquering
his own ridiculous fears—fears that partook
of the nature of actual forewarnings—Knutsen
drove his oars with added force into the
water. The boat leaped forward: in a moment
more they touched the bank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their deliverer, a great blond man seemingly of
Northeastern Europe, was already at the water’s
edge, watching them with a strange and inexplicable
glitter in gray, sardonic eyes. He was a
mighty, bearded man, clothed in furs; already he
was bent, his hands on the bow of the boat. Already
Ned was climbing out upon the shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Partly to remove the silly dismay that had overwhelmed
him, partly because it was the first
thought that would come to the mind of a wayfarer
of the sea, Knutsen turned with a question. “What
island is dis?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stranger turned with a grim, meaning smile.
“Hell,” he answered simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both Ned and Knutsen stood erect to stare at
him. The wind made curious whispers down
through the long slit of the river valley. “Hell?”
Knutsen echoed. “Is dat its name——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the name I gave it. You’ll think it’s that
before you get away.”</p>

<div><h1>XIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> stranger’s voice was deep and full, so far-carrying,
so masterful, that it might have been the
articulation of the raw elements among which he
lived, rather than the utterance of human vocal
chords. It held all his listeners; it wakened Lenore
from the apathy brought by cold and exposure.
They had wondered, at first, that a member of the
white race should make his home on this remote and
desolate isle, but after they had heard his voice they
knew that this was his fitting environment. If any
man’s home should be here, in this lost and snowy
desert, here was the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The background of the North was reflected in
his voice. It was as if he had caught its tone from
the sea and the wild, through long acquaintance
with them. It was commanding, passionate, and
yet, to a man of rare sensitiveness, it would have
had an unmistakable quality of beauty; at least,
something that is like beauty and which can be
heard in many of Nature’s voices: the chant of the
wolf pack on the ridge, or even certain sounds of
beating waves. The explanation was simply that
he had lived so long in the North, he was so intrinsically
its child in nature and temperament,
that it had begun to mold him after its own raw
forces. The fact that his voice had a deeply sardonic
note was wholly in character. The North,
too, has a cruel, grim humor that breaks men’s
hearts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His accent was plainly not that of an American.
He had not been born to the English tongue; very
plainly he had learned it, thoroughly and laboriously.
His own tongue still echoed faintly in the
way he mouthed some of his vowels, and in a distinct
purring note, as of a giant cat, in his softer
sounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned observed these things more in an inner mind,
rather than with his conscious intelligence. Outwardly
he was simply listening to what the man
said. The note of dimness and unreality was wholly
gone now. The voice was indescribably vivid; the
man himself was compellingly vivid too. It was
no longer to be wondered at that he had appeared
of such gigantic proportions when they had seen
him across the snow. In reality he was a giant of
a man, about six feet and a half in height, huge of
body, mighty of arm and limb, weighing, stripped
down to muscle and sinew, practically three hundred
pounds. Beside him, Knutsen no longer gave
the image of strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even in his own city, surrounded by the civilization
that he loved, Ned couldn’t have passed this
man by with a casual glance. In the first place
there is something irresistibly compelling about
mere physical strength. The strength of this man
beside the sea seemed resistless. It was to be seen
in his lithe motions; his great, long-fingered, big-knuckled
hands; in the lurch of his shoulders; in
his great thighs and long, powerful arms. He was
plainly, as far as age went, at the apex of his
strength,—not over forty-one, not less than thirty-eight.
He drew up the boat with one hand, reaching
the other to help Lenore out on to the shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It came about, because he reached it toward Lenore,
that Ned noticed his hand before ever he
really took time to study his face. It was a mighty,
muscular hand,—a reaching, clasping, clenching,
killing hand. It crushed the lives from things that
its owner didn’t like. On the back and extending
almost to the great, purple nails was blond, coarse
hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it wasn’t mere brute strength that made him
the compelling personality that he was. There was
also the strength of an iron purpose, a self-confidence
gained by battle with and conquest of the
raw forces of his island home. Here was a man
who knew no law but his own. And he was as remorseless
as the snow that sifted down upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If Lenore’s thought processes had been the same
as when she had left her city home, she would have
been stirred to envy by his garb. There was little
about him that suggested intercourse with the outside
world. He was dressed from head to foot in
furs and skins of the most rare and beautiful kinds.
His jacket and trousers seemed to be of lynx, his
cap was unmistakably silver fox. But it came
about that neither she nor Ned did more than
casually notice his garb: both were held and darkly
fascinated by the great, bearded face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The blond hair grew in a great mat about his
lips and jowls. His nose was straight, his eyebrows
heavy, all his features remarkably even
and well-proportioned. But none of these lesser
features could be noticed because of the compelling
attraction of his gray, vivid eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned didn’t know why he was startled, so carried
out of himself when he looked at them. In the first
place they were the index of what was once, and
perhaps still, a lively and penetrating intelligence.
This island man, however mad he might be, was not
a mere physical hulk,—an ox with dull nerves and
stupid brain. The vivid orbs indicated a nervous
system that was highly developed and sensitive,
though heaven knew what slant, what paths from
the normal, the development took. They were not
the eyes of a man blind to beauty, dull to art. He
was likely fully sensitive to the dreadful, eerie
beauty of his own northern home; if anything, it
got home to him too deeply and invoked in him its
own terrible mood. They were sardonic eyes too,—the
eyes of a man who, secure in his own
strength, knew men’s weaknesses and knew how to
make use of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet none of these traits got down to the real soul
of the man. They didn’t even explain the wild and
piercing glitter in the gray orbs. Whatever his
creed was, he was a fanatic in it. An inhuman zeal
marked every word, every glance. There is a
proper balance to maintain in life, a quietude, most
of all a temperance in all things; and to lose it
means to pass beyond the pale. This island man
was irremediably steeped in some ghastly philosophy
of his own; a dreadful code of life outside the
laws of heaven and earth. Some evil disease, not
named in any work on medicine, had distilled its
dire toxin into his heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is no law of God or man north of sixty-three,—and
the thing held good with him. But
there is devil’s law; and it was the law on which his
life was bent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the most evil, the most terrible face that
any one of these four had ever seen. The art that
touched him was never true art, the art of the soul
and the heart, but something diseased, something
uncanny and diabolical, beyond the pale of life.
His genius was an evil genius: they saw it in every
motion, in every line of his wicked face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no kindly warmth, no sympathy, no
human understanding either in his voice or his face.
Plainly he was as remorseless as the remorseless
land in which he lived. Now, as they looked, his
hairy hands might have been the rending paws of a
beast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps it was madness, perhaps some weird abnormality
that only a great psychologist could
trace, perhaps merely wickedness without redemption,
but whatever the nature of the disease that
was upon him it had had a ghastly and inhuman influence.
The heart in his breast had lost the high,
human attributes of mercy and sympathy. They
knew in one glance that here was a man that knew
no restraints other than those prompted by his own
desires. In him the self-will and resolution that
carries so many men into power or crime was developed
to the <span class='it'>nth</span> power; he was a fitting child
of the savage powers of nature among which he
lived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pardon me for not making myself known
sooner,” he began in his deep, sardonic voice. “My
name is Doomsdorf—trapper, and seemingly
owner of this island. At least I’m the only living
man on it, except yourselves.” His speech, though
careless and queerly accented, had no mark of ignorance
or ill-breeding. “I told you the island’s
name—believe me, it fits it perfectly. Welcome
to it——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned straightened, white-faced. “Mr. Doomsdorf,
these girls are chilled through—one of them
is near to collapse from exposure. Will you save
that till later and help me get them to a fire?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For all the creeping terror that was possessing
his veins, Ned made a brave effort to hold his voice
steady. The man looked down at him, his lip curling.
“Pardon my negligence,” he replied easily.
“Of course she isn’t used to the cold yet—but that
will come in time.” He bowed slightly to the shivering
girl on the shore. “If you follow my tracks
up to the wood, you’ll find my shack—and there’s
a fire in the stove.” He looked familiarly into her
face. “You’re not really cold, you know—you
just <span class='it'>think</span> you are. Walk fast, and it will warm
you up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned bent, seized an armful of blankets from the
boat, then stepped to Lenore’s side. “The captain
will help you, Miss Gilbert,” he said to Bess. Then
he and the golden-haired girl he loved started together
through the six-inch snowfall toward the
woods. Bess, stricken and appalled, but yet not
knowing which way to turn, took the trail behind
them. But Knutsen still waited on the shore, beside
the boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came of a strong breed, and he was known in
his own world as a strong man. It was part of the
teaching of that world, and always the instinct of
such men as he to look fate in the face, never to
evade it, never to seek shelter in false hope. He
knew the world better than any of the three who
had come with him; the menace that they sensed but
dimly but which dismayed and oppressed them was
only too real to him. Even now, out of his sight,
Ned was trying to make himself believe that the
man was likely but a simple trapper, distorted into
a demon by the delirium brought on by the dreadful
night just passed; but Knutsen made no such attempt.
He saw in Doomsdorf a perfect embodiment
of the utter ruthlessness and brutality that
the Far North sometimes bestows on its sons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Knutsen knew this north country. He knew of
what it was capable,—the queer, uncanny quirks
that it put in the souls of men. Doomsdorf, incredible
to Ned and Bess, was wholly plausible to
him. He feared him to the depths of his heart, yet
in some measure, at least, these three were in his
charge, and if worst came to worst, he must stand
between them and this island devil with his own life.
He had stayed on the shore after the others had
gone so that he might find out the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was not long in learning. Through some innate,
vague, almost inexplicable desire to shelter his
three charges and to spare them the truth, he
wanted to wait until all three of them had disappeared
in the wood; but even this was denied him.
Lenore and Ned, it is true, had already vanished
into the patch of forest; but Bess seemed to be
walking slowly, waiting for him. Doomsdorf was
bent, now, unloading the stores and remaining
blankets from the canoe; but suddenly, with one
motion, he showed Knutsen where he stood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With one great lurch of his shoulders he turned
over the empty boat and shoved it off into the sea.
The first wave, catching it, drove it out of reach.
“You won’t need that again,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a half-uttered, sobbing gasp that no man
had heard from his lips before, Knutsen sprang to
rescue it. It was the greatest error of his life.
Even he did not realize the full might and remorselessness
of the foe that opposed him, or he would
never have wasted precious seconds, put himself at
a disadvantage by entering the water, in trying to
retrieve the boat. He would have struck instantly,
in one absolute, desperate attempt to wipe the danger
forever from his path. But in the instant of
need, his brain did not work true. He could not
exclude from his thought the disastrous fallacy
that all hope, all chances to escape from hell lay
only in this flimsy craft, floating a few feet from
him in shallow water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In an instant he had seized it, and standing hip-deep
in the icy water, he turned to face the blond
man on the shore. The latter roared once with
savage mirth, a sound that carried far abroad the
snowy desolation; then he sobered, watching with
glittering eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let it go,” he ordered simply. His right arm
lifted slowly, as if in inadvertence, and rested almost
limp across his breast. His blond beard hid
the contemptuous curl of his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damn you, I won’t!” Knutsen answered.
“You can’t keep us here——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let it go, I say. You are the one that’s
damned. And you fool, you don’t know the words
that are written over the gates of the hell you’ve
come to—‘Abandon hope, ye who enter here!’
You and your crowd will never leave this island till
you die!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Knutsen’s hand moved toward his hip. In the
days of the gun fights, in the old North, it had
never moved more swiftly. In this second of need
he had remembered his pistol.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he remembered it too late. And his hand,
though fast, was infinitely slow. The great arm
that lay across Doomsdorf’s breast suddenly flashed
out and up. The blue steel of a revolver barrel
streaked in the air, and a shot cracked over the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Knutsen was already loosed from the bonds that
held him. Deliverance had come quickly. His
face, black before with wrath, grew blank; and for
a long instant he groped impotently, open hands
reaching. But the lead had gone straight home;
and there was no need of a second shot. The late
captain of the <span class='it'>Charon</span> swayed, then pitched forward
into the gray waters.</p>

<div><h1>XIV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Bess</span> had followed the trail through the snow
clear to the dark edge of the woods when the sound
of voices behind her caused her to turn. Neither
Doomsdorf nor Knutsen had spoken loudly. Indeed,
their tones had been more subdued than usual,
as is often the way when men speak in moments of
absolute test. Bess had not made out the words:
only the deep silence and the movements of the
wind from the sea enabled her to hear the voices at
all. Thus it was curious that she whirled, face
blanching, in knowledge of the impending crisis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thereafter the drama on the shore seemed to her
as something that could not possibly be true. She
saw in the deep silence Doomsdorf overturn and
push off the boat, Knutsen’s desperate effort to rescue
it, the flash of light from the former’s upraised
pistol. And still immersed in that baffling silence,
the brave seaman had groped, swayed, then toppled
forward into the shallow water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a long time after that the report of the
pistol reached her ears, and even this was not
enough to waken her to a sense of reality. It
sounded dull, far-off, conveying little of the terrible
thing it was, inadequate to account for the unutterable
disaster that it had occasioned. Afterward
the silence closed down again. The waves rolled in
through the harbor mouth with never a pause. The
dark shadow that lay for an instant on the face of
the waters slowly sank beneath. The boat drifted
ever farther out to sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Except for the fact that Doomsdorf stood alone
on the shore, it might have been all the factless incident
of a tragic dream. The blond man walked
closer to the water, peering; then the pistol gleamed
again as he pocketed it. The wind still brushed by,
singing sadly as it went; and the sleet swept out of
the clouds. And then, knowing her need, she
strove to waken the blunted powers of her will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She must not yield herself to the horror that encroached
upon her. Only impotence, only disaster
lay that way. She must hold steady, not break
into hopeless sobs, not fall kneeling in impotent
appeal. Bess Gilbert was of good metal, but this
test that had been put upon her seemed to wrench
apart the fibers of her inmost being. But she won
the fight at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly she stiffened, rallying her faculties, fighting
off the apathy of terror. Presently her whole
consciousness seemed to sharpen. In an instant of
clear thought she guessed, broadly, the truth of that
tragedy beside the sea; that Knutsen had died in a
desperate attempt to break free from an unspeakable
trap into which he and his charges had fallen.
He had preferred to take the chance of death rather
than submit to the fate that Doomsdorf had in store
for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just what that fate was and how it concerned
herself, Bess dared not guess. She had known a
deadly fear of Doomsdorf at the first glance; she
had instinctively hated him as she had never hated
any living creature before; and now she knew that
this was the most desperate moment of her life. He
had shown himself capable of any depth of crime;
and that meant there must be no limit to her own
courage. She too must take any chance of freedom
that offered, no matter how desperate; for no
evil that could befall her seemed as terrible as his
continued power over her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It meant she must work quick. She must not
lose a single chance. The odds were desperately
long already: she must not increase them. In an
instant more he would be glancing about to see if
his crime were observed. If she could conceal the
fact that she had witnessed it, he would not be so
much on guard in the moment of crisis that was to
come. Her body and soul seemed to rally to
mighty effort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was already at the edge of the timber.
Stooping down, she made one leap into its shelter.
She was none too soon: already Doomsdorf had
looked back to see if the coast were clear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everything depended on Ned, henceforth. She
couldn’t work alone. With his aid, perhaps, they
could destroy this evil power under which they had
fallen before it could prepare to meet them.
Doomsdorf’s cabin—a long, log structure on the
bank of a dark little stream—was only a hundred
feet distant in the wood. Now that she was out of
sight of the shore, she broke into a frenzied run.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had no desperate plan as yet. In Ned’s
manhood alone lay her hope: perhaps in the moment
or two before Doomsdorf appeared Ned
could conceive of some plan to meet him. Perhaps
there was a rifle in the cabin!</p>

<p class='pindent'>She fought back the instinct to scream out her
story from the doorway. At the bidding of an instinct
so sure and true that it partook of a quality
of infallibility, she checked her wild pace before she
crossed the threshold. Everything depended on
Ned and the cool, strong quality of Ned’s nerves.
She must not jeopardize his self-control by bursting
in upon him in frenzy, perhaps exciting him to
such an extent that he would be rendered helpless
to aid her. She must keep him cool by being cool
herself. She caught her breath in a curious deep
gasp, then stepped into the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then that gasp became very nearly a sob. The
way of deliverance was not clear. A wrinkled native
woman, an Aleut or an Eskimo, who was evidently
Doomsdorf’s wife, looked up at her with
dark inscrutable eyes from the opposite side of the
room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a heart-breaking blow to Bess’s hopes.
The presence of the woman increased, to a dread
degree, the odds against her. She was ugly,
brown as leather, heavily built; her face gave no
sign that human emotion had ever touched her
heart, yet she was likely a staunch ally of their foe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole picture went home to her in a glance.
Lenore was huddled in a chair before the stove,
yielding herself to the blessed warmth, already
shaking off the semi-apathy induced by the night’s
chill. But as yet there was no hope in her. She
was shivering, helpless, impotent. Ned bent over
her, his arms about her, now and then giving her
sips from a cup of hot liquid that he held in his
hand. His care, his tender solicitude, struck Bess
with a sense of unutterable irony. Evidently he
had no suspicion of the real truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked up as Bess entered. Partly because
the light was dim, partly because he was absorbed
in the work of caring for Lenore to the exclusion of
all other thought, he failed to see the drawn look of
horror on Bess’s face. “I’ll need a little help here,
Miss Gilbert,” he said. “I want to get this girl to
bed. The night seemed to go harder with her than
with the rest of us, and rest is the best thing for
her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bess almost sobbed aloud. The sound caught in
her throat, but quickly she forced it back. Ned
was already himself again; the danger and stress of
the night had seemingly affected him only so far as
to enscribe his face with tired lines, to leave him
somewhat hollow-eyed and drawn. In reality, he
was the man of cities come again. He was on solid
earth; food and shelter and warmth were his once
more; his old self-confidence was surging through
him with the glow from the stove. He had no inkling
of the truth. His mind was far from danger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that instant she knew she must work alone.
She must give no sign of her own desperation before
this stolid squaw. And yet she almost
screamed with horror when she realized that any
second she might hear Doomsdorf’s step on the
threshold. She glanced about till she located the
Russian’s rifle, hung on the wall almost in front of
the squaw’s chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you hear a shot?” she asked. With all the
powers of her spirit, she kept her voice commonplace,
casual.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Ned answered. “It wasn’t anything—was
it?” His tone became cold. “Will you
please give me a little help with Miss Hardenworth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was a bear—Mr. Doomsdorf shot at it with
his pistol,” she went on in the same casual way.
She thought it incredible that they would not take
alarm from the wild beating of her heart. She
turned easily to the squaw. “He wants me to
bring his rifle so he can shoot at it again,” she said.
“That’s it—on the wall?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stepped toward the weapon. Even in her
own heart she did not know what was her plan of
action after that gun was in her hands: she had not
yet given thought to the stress and desperate deed
that lay before her. She only knew that life, honor,
everything that mattered in this world depended on
the developments of the next few seconds. Later,
perhaps, resistance would be crushed out of her;
her cruel master would be constantly on guard: in
this little moment lay her one chance. She knew
vaguely that if she could procure the weapon, she
could start down to the shore and meet Doomsdorf
on the way. Perhaps her nerve would break soon;
it could not keep up forever under such a strain.
Thus her whole universe depended on immediate
action. She must not hesitate now. She must go
any lengths. Her eyes were cold and remorseless
under her straight brows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure—take him gun,” the squaw answered
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was vaguely aware that Ned was watching
her in amazement. He was speaking too, his voice
coming from infinitely far off. “I’m surprised,
Miss Gilbert,” he was saying with grave displeasure.
“You don’t seem to realize that Miss Hardenworth
is still in a serious condition. Perhaps
you will be willing to forget Mr. Doomsdorf’s sport
for a moment——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Bess hardly heard. Her hands were trembling,
waiting for the feel of the steel. Now the
Indian was getting up and presently was lifting
down the weapon. But she did not put it at once
into Bess’s hands. She pushed back the lever, revealing
the empty breech. Then Bess saw a slow
drawing of her lips—a cruel upturning that was
seemingly as near as she could come to a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure—take him gun,” she said. “Got any
shells——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bess shook her head. Her heart paused in her
breast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe him got shells. He took ’em all out
when he saw your canoe come in.”</p>

<div><h1>XV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>If</span>, like her husband, the brown squaw was a
devotee of cruelty, she must have received great
satisfaction from the sight of that slender, girlish
figure standing in the gloom of the cabin. The
fact that there were no shells in the rifle—otherwise
a desperate agent of escape—seemed nothing
less than the death of hope. The strength born of
the crisis departed swiftly from her, and her only
impulse was to yield to bitter tears. Her erect
body seemed to wilt, her sensitive lips, so straight
and firm before, drooped like those of a child in
some utter, unconsolable tragedy of childhood. It
was a curious thing how the light died in her eyes.
All at once they seemed to be at some strange, below-zero
point of darkness,—like black wounds in
the utter whiteness of her face. Yet the squaw
gave no sign that she had seen. Her face was impassive,
that of an imperturbable Buddha that sits
forever in a far temple.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Great terror is nothing more or less than temporary
loss of hope. In that moment Bess was finding
out what real hopelessness meant, so far as it is
ever possible for human beings to know. For that
moment she couldn’t see a rift in the darkness that
enfolded her. In the first place she felt infinitely
alone: Knutsen was dead; Lenore still sat yielding
to self-pity; Ned still extended to her his solicitous
care. The thing went beyond mere fear of death.
She could conceive of possibilities now wherein
death would be a thing desired and prayed for; a
deliverance from a living hell that was infinitely
worse. The terror that was upon her was incomparable
with any previous experience of her life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet her eyes remained dry. Some way, she was
beyond the beneficence of tears; partly because of
her terror, partly, perhaps, because the instinct was
with her yet to hide the truth from Ned and Lenore
so long as possible. Thus she was not, in the last
analysis, absolutely bereft of hope. It might be,
since Ned was a man and she a woman, he would
never become the prey of Doomsdorf to such a degree
as she herself. And now there was no time to
try to formulate other plans; to seek some other
gateway of escape; no time more to listen to Ned’s
complaints of her inattention to Lenore. She
heard Doomsdorf’s heavy step at the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man came in, for an instant standing framed
by the doorway, the light of morning behind him.
Ned looked up, expecting some inquiry as to his
own and Lenore’s condition, some word of greeting
on his lips. It came about, however, that his
thought fell quickly into other channels. Doomsdorf
closed the door behind him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man turned contemptuously to Ned.
“What’s the matter?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Startled and indignant at the tone, Ned instinctively
straightened. “I didn’t say anything was
the matter. Where’s Knutsen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Knutsen—has gone on. Hell didn’t suit him.
He went against its mandates the first thing. I
hope it doesn’t happen again—I would hate to
lose any more of you. I’ve other plans in mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned hardly understood, yet his face went white.
Partly it was anger because of the unmistakable insult
and contempt in Doomsdorf’s tone. Partly it
was a vague fear that his good sense would not permit
him to credit. “I don’t—I don’t understand,
I’m afraid,” he remarked coldly. “We’ll talk it
over later. At present I want to know where we
can put this girl to bed. She’s in a serious condition
from her last night’s experience.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lips curled under the great blond beard.
“I may put her to bed, all right—if I like her
looks,” he answered evenly. “It won’t be your
bed, either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Appalled, unbelieving, yet obeying a racial instinct
that goes back to the roots of time, Ned
dropped the girl from his arms and leaped to his
feet. His eyes blazed with a magnificent burst
of fury, and a mighty oath was at his lips.
“You——” he began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet no second word came. Doomsdorf’s great
body lunged across the room with the ferocity and
might of a charging bear. His arm went out like a
javelin, great fingers extended, and clutched with
the effect of a mighty mechanical trap the younger
man’s throat. He caught him as he might catch a
vicious dog he intended to kill, snatching him off his
feet. Ned’s arm lashed out impotently, and forcing
through with his own body, Doomsdorf thrust
him into the corner. For a moment he battered
him back and forth, hammering his head against the
wall, then let him fall to a huddled heap on the
floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lenore’s voice raised in a piercing scream of terror;
but a fiercer instinct took hold of Bess. The
impulse that moved her was simply that to fight to
the death, now as well as later. A heavy hammer,
evidently a tool recently in use by Doomsdorf, lay
on the window sill, and she sprang for it with the
strength of desperation. But her hand had hardly
touched it before she herself was hurled back
against the log wall behind her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The squaw had not sat supine in this stress.
With the swiftness and dexterity of an animal, she
had sprung to intercept the deadly blow, hurling
the girl back by her hand upon the latter’s shoulder.
If she made any sound at all, it was a single, chattering
sentence that was mostly obliterated in the
sound of battle. And already, before seemingly a
second was past, Doomsdorf was standing back in
his place in the center of the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Except for the huddled heap in the blood-spattered
corner of the cabin, it was as if it had never
happened. The squaw was again stolid, moving
slowly back to her chair; Doomsdorf breathed
quietly and evenly. The two girls stood staring in
speechless horror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope there won’t be any more of that,”
Doomsdorf said quietly. “The sooner we get
these little matters straightened out, the better for
all concerned. It isn’t pleasant to be hammered to
pieces, is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took one step toward Ned, and Lenore
started to scream again. But he inflicted no
further punishment. He reached a strong hand,
seized Ned’s shoulder, and snatched him to his
feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t try it again,” he advised. “Here in this
cabin—on this island—I do and say what I like.
I don’t stand for any resentment. The next time
it won’t be so easy, and that will be too bad for
everybody. You wouldn’t be able to do your
work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Racked by pain but fully conscious, Ned looked
into the glittering eyes. It was no longer possible
to disbelieve in this hairy giant before him. The
agony in his throat muscles was only too real. And
the only recourse that occurred to him was one of
pitiful inadequacy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a moment of test for Ned, and he knew of
no way to meet it except as he met such little crises
as sometimes occurred to him in his native city.
The only code of life he knew was that he practiced
in his old life: now was its time of trial. His own
blood on his hands; the grim, wicked face before
him should have been enough to convince a man less
inured in his own creed of self-sufficiency and conceit;
yet Ned would not let himself believe that he
had found his master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a child has recourse to senseless threats, he
tried to take refuge in his old attitude of superiority.
“I don’t know what you mean, and I don’t
care to,” he said at last. In pity for him Bess’s
eyes filled with tears. “I only know we won’t accept
the hospitality of such men as you. We’ll go—right
now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Doomsdorf’s answer was a roaring laugh of
scorn. Presently he walked to the door and threw
it wide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he wasn’t smiling when he turned back to
face them, the morning light on his bearded face.
The sight of the North through the open door had
sobered and awed him, as it awes all men who know
its power. Beyond lay only the edge of the forest
and the snow-swept barrens, stretching down to a
gray and desolate sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s snowing a little, isn’t it?” he said. “Just
the North—keeping its tail up and letting us
know it’s here. Where, my young friend, do you
think of going?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It doesn’t matter——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s snow and cold out there.” His voice
was deeply sober. “Death too—sure as you’re
standing here. A weakling like you can’t live in
that, out there. None of your kind can stand it—they’d
die like so many sheep. And as a result you
have to bow down and serve the man that can!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned had no answer. The greatest fear of his
life was clamping down upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the law up here—that the weak have
to serve the strong. I’ve beat the North at its own
game, and it serves me, just as you’re going to serve
me now. You’re not accepting any hospitality
from me. You’re going to pay for the warmth of
this fire I’ve grubbed out of these woods—you’ll
pay for the food you eat. You can go out there if
you like—if you prefer to die. There’s no boat
to carry you off. There never will be a boat to
carry you off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned’s breath caught in a gasp. “My God, you
don’t mean you’ll hold us here by force!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean you’re my prisoners here for the rest of
your natural lives. And you can abandon hope
just as surely as if this island was the real hell it
was named for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quietly, coldly he told them their fate, these
three who had been cast up by the sea. He didn’t
mince words. And for all the strangeness of the
scene—the gray light of the dawn and the snow
against the window and the noise of the wind without—they
knew it was all true, not merely some
shadowed vista of an eerie dream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You might as well know how you stand, first as
last,” he began. “When you once get everything
through your heads, maybe we won’t have any more
trouble such as we had just now. You ought to be
glad that the seaman—Knutsen, you called him?—is
sliding around on the sea bottom instead of being
here with you; he’d be a source of trouble from beginning
to end. He’d have been hard to teach,
hard to master—I saw that in the beginning—and
he’d never give in short of a fight every morning
and every night. None of you, fortunately,
are that way. You’ll see how things stack up, and
we’ll all get along nicely together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paused, smiling grimly; then with an explosive
motion, pulled back the lid of the stove and
threw in another log. “Sit down, why don’t you?”
he invited. “I don’t insist on my servants standing
up always in my presence. You’ll have to sit
down sometime, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lenore, wholly despondent, sank back in her
seat. To show that he was still her protector, Ned
stood behind her, his hands resting on the back of
her chair. Bess stole to a little rough seat between
them and the squaw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A single great chair was left vacant, almost in
the middle of the circle. Doomsdorf glanced once
about the room as if guarding against any possibility
of surprise attack by his prisoners, then sat
down easily himself. “Excuse me for not making
you known to my woman,” he began. “In fact, I
haven’t even learned your own names. She is,
translating from the vernacular, ‘Owl-That-Never-Sleeps.’
You won’t be expected to call her that,
however—although I regret as a general thing
that the picturesque native names so often undergo
such laceration on the tongues of the whites. When
I took her from her village, they gave her to me as
‘Sindy.’ You may call her that. It will do as
good as any—every other squaw from Tin City to
Ketchikan is called Sindy. It means nothing, as
far as I know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Owl-That-Never-Sleeps,’ however, fits her
very well. You might make a point of it. And if
you are interested in the occult sciences, perhaps
you might explain to me how, when she was a pappoose,
her parents could understand her character
and nature well enough to give her a name that fits
her so perfectly. I notice the same thing happens
again and again through these northern tribes.
But I’m wandering off the point. Sindy, you must
know, speaks English and is second in command.
What she says goes. Get up and do it on the jump.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll be interested to know that you are on
one of the supposedly uninhabited islands of the
Skopin group. Other islands are grouped all
around you, making one big snow field when the ice
closes down in winter. I could give you almost
your exact longitudinal position, but it wouldn’t be
the least good to you. The population consists of
we five people—and various bear, caribou, and
such like. The principal industry, as you will find
out later, is furs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no need to tell in detail how and why
I came here—unlike Caliban, I am not a native of
the place. I hope you are not so deficient as to
have failed to read ‘Tempest.’ I find quite an
analogy to our present condition. Shakespeare is
a great delight on wintry nights; he remains real,
when most of my other slim stock of authors fades
into air. I like ‘Merry Wives’ the best of the
comedies, though—because we have such fine fun
with Falstaff. Of the tragedies I like Macbeth the
best and Lear, by far the worst; and it’s a curious
paradox that I didn’t like the ending of the first
and did like the second. Macbeth and his lady
shouldn’t have fallen. They were people with a
purpose, and purpose should be allowed to triumph
in art as well as in life. In life, Macbeth would
have snipped off Macduff’s head and left a distinguished
line. Lear, old and foolish, got just
what was coming to him—only it shouldn’t have
been dragged over five acts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I really must get down to essentials. It’s
so long since I’ve talked to the outside world that
I can’t help being garrulous. To begin with—I
came here some years ago, not entirely by my own
choice. Of course, not even the devil comes to such
a hell as this from his own choice. There’s always
pressure from above.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paused again, hardly aware of the horrified
gaze with which his hearers regarded him. A startling
change had come over him when he spoke
again. His eyes looked red as a weasel’s in the
shadowed room; the tones of his voice were more
subdued, yet throbbing with passion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I remember gray walls, long ago, in Siberia,”
he went on slowly and gravely. “I was not much
more than a boy, a student at a great university—and
then there were gray walls in a gray, snow-swept
land, and gray cells with barred doors, and
men standing ever on watch with loaded rifles, and
thousands of human cattle in prison garb. It was
almost straight west of here, far beyond Bering
Sea; and sometimes inspectors would come, stylish
people like yourselves, except that they were
bearded men of Petrograd, and look at us through
the bars as at animals in a zoo, but they never interfered
with the way things were run! How I
came there doesn’t matter; what I did, and what I
didn’t do. There I found out how much toil the
human back can stand without breaking, one day
like another, years without end. I knew what it
was to have a taskmaster stand over me with a whip—a
whip with many tails, with a shot and wire
twisted into each. I can show you my back now if
you don’t believe me. I found out all these things,
and right then there came a desire to teach them
to some one else. I was an enemy of society, they
said—so I became an enemy of society in reality.
Right then I learned a hate for such society and a
desire to burn out the heart of such weak things as
you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned to them, snarling like a beast. His
voice had begun to rumble like lavas in the bowels
of the earth. There could be no question as to the
reality of this hatred. It was a storm cloud over
his face; it filled his gray eyes with searing fire,
it drew his muscles till it seemed that the arms of
his chair, clutched by his hands, would be torn from
the rounds. To his listeners it was the most terribly
vivid moment of their lives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I swore an oath then, by the devil himself, that
if the time ever came that I’d have opportunity,
I’d show society just what kind of an enemy I was.
Sometime, I thought, that time would come. What
made me think so I can’t tell. Sometime I’d pay
’em back for all they had done to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One day the chance came to escape. While
more cowardly men would have hesitated, I pushed
through and out. On the way I learned a little
lesson—that none of the larger creatures of the
wild die as easily as men. I found out that there is
nothing more to killing a man that is in your way
than killing a caribou I want to eat. I didn’t feel
any worse about it afterward. After that I decided
I would never compromise with a man who
was in my way. The other method was too easy.
Remember it in all our relations to come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had to come across here. I couldn’t forever
escape the hue and cry that was raised. Ultimately
I landed on this little island—with Sindy and a
few steel traps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In this climate we can trap almost the whole
year round. We can start putting them out in a
few days more—keep them out clear till June.
Every year a ship—the <span class='it'>Intrepid</span> that you’ve likely
heard of—touches here to buy my furs—just one
trip a year—and it leaves here supplies of all kinds
in exchange. But don’t take hope from that.
Hope is one thing you want to get out of your
systems. The captain of the <span class='it'>Intrepid</span> and his
Japanese crew are the only human beings that
know I live here, except yourself—that know
there’s a human occupant on this island. On their
yearly visit I’ll see to it that none of them get a
sight of you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Once I was used to working all day from dawn
to dark, with an armed master on guard over me.
It isn’t going to be that way from now on. I’m
going to be the armed master. The next few days
you’re going to spend building yourselves a shack
and cutting winter fuel. Then each of you will
have a trap line—a good stiff one, too. Every day
you’ll go out and follow your line of traps—baiting,
skinning and fleshing, drying the skins when
you get to the cabins. You’ll know what it really
is to be cold, then; you’ll know what work means,
too. With you three I expect to triple my usual
season’s catch, building up three times as fast the
fortune I need.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All my life I’ve looked forward to a chance to
give society the same kind of treatment it gave to
me—and when that fortune is large enough to work
with, there will be a new dynasty arise in Russia.
In the meantime, you’re going to get the same
treatment I did—hard labor for life! You’re going
to have an armed guard over you to shoot you
down if you show the least sign of mutiny. You’ll
obey every command and lick my boots if I tell
you to. I said then, when the chance came, I’d
grind society down—or any representatives of society
that came into my power—just as it ground
me down. This is the beginning of my triumph.
You, you three—represent all I hated. Wealth—constituted
authority—softness and ease and
luxury. I’ll teach you what softness is! You’ll
know what a heaven a hard bed can be, after a day
in the wind off Bering Straits. You’ll find out
what luxury is, too.” His wild laugh blew like a
wind through the room. “And incidentally, my
fur output will be increased by three, my final
dream brought three times nearer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What I want from you I’ll take. You’re in
hell if there is such a place—and you’ll know it
plenty soon.” He turned to Ned, his lip curled in
scorn. “Your feeble arms over the chair back
won’t protect that girl if I make up my mind I
want her. At present you may be safe from that—simply
because some conquests aren’t any pleasure
if they’re made with force. If I want either of
you,” his gaze flashed toward Bess, “I’m not afraid
that I’ll have to descend to force to get you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I said to abandon hope I meant it. You
have no boat, and I’ll give you no chance to make
one. The distance is too great across the ice ever
to make it through; besides, you won’t be given a
chance to try. No ships will come here to look for
you. No matter what wealth and power you represented
down there, you’ll be forgotten soon enough.
Others will take your place, other girls will reign
at the balls, and other men will spend your money.
You will be up here, as lost and forgotten as if
you were in the real hell you’ll go to in the end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even if your doting fathers should send out a
search party, they will overlook this little island.
It was just a freak of the currents that you landed
here—I don’t see yet why you weren’t blown to
Tzar Island, immediately east of here. When they
find you aren’t there, and pick up any other lifeboats
from your ship that in all probability landed
there, they’ll be glad enough to turn around and go
back. Especially if they see your lifeboat floating
bottom upward in the water!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You should never have come to the North, you
three! Society should never move from the civilization
that has been built to protect it—otherwise it
will find forces too big and too cruel to master.
You’re all weaklings, soft as putty—without the
nerve of a ptarmigan. Already I’ve crushed the
resistance out of you. All my life I’ve dreamed
of some such chance as this, and yet you can’t fight
enough to make it interesting for me. You’ll be
docile, hopeless slaves until you die.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paused, scanning their pale, drawn faces.
He turned to Ned first, but the latter was too immersed
in his own despair ever to return his stare.
Lenore didn’t raise her golden head to meet his
eyes. But before his gaze ever got to her, Bess was
on her feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be too sure of yourself,” she cautioned
quickly. He looked with sudden amazement into
her kindling eyes. “Men like you have gone in the
face of society before. You’re not so far up here
that the arm of the law can’t reach you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The blond man smiled into her earnest face.
“Go on, my dear,” he urged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s got you once, and it’ll get you again. And
I warn you that if you put one indignity on us, do
one thing you’ve said—you’ll pay for it in the end—just
as you’ll pay for that fiendish crime you
committed to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As her eyes met his, straight and unfaltering, the
expression of contemptuous amazement died in his
face. Presently his interest seemed to quicken. It
was as if he had seen her for the first time, searching
eyes resting first on hers, then on her lips, dropping
down over her athletic form, and again into
her eyes. He seemed lost in sinister speculations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something seemed strained, ready to break. The
four in the little circle made no motion, all of them
inert and frozen like characters in a dream. And
then, before that speculative, searching gaze—a
gaze unlike any that he had bent on Lenore—her
eyes faltered from his. Ned felt a wild, impotent
fury like live steam in his brain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bess’s little mutiny was already quelled. Her
blue eyes were black with terror.</p>

<div><h1>XVI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Doomsdorf</span> had seemingly achieved his purpose,
and his prisoners lay crushed in his hands. A fear
infinitely worse than that of toil or hardship had
evidently killed the fighting spirit in Bess; Lenore
had been broken by Doomsdorf’s first words. And
now all the structure of Ned’s life had seemingly
toppled about him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lesson that Doomsdorf taught had gone
deep, not to be forgotten in any happier moment
that life might have in store for him. There was no
blowing into flame the ashes of his old philosophy.
It was dead and cold in his breast; no matter what
turn fate should take, his old conceit and self-sufficiency
could never come again. He was down
to earth at last. The game had been too big for
him. The old Ned Cornet was dead, and only a
broken, impotent, hopeless thing was left to dwell
in his battered body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had found the training camp, but it was more
bitter than ever his father had hinted that it could
be. Indeed Godfrey Cornet, in those brooding
prophecies at which his son had laughed, had been
all too hopeful regarding it. He had said there
was a way through and on, always there was a way
through and on; but here the only out-trail was
one of infinite shadow to an unknown destination.
Death—<span class='it'>that</span> was the way out. <span class='it'>That</span> was the only
way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was curious how easy it was to think of death.
Formerly the word had invoked a sense of something
infinitely distant, nothing that could seemingly
touch him closely, a thought that never came
clearly into focus in his brain. All at once it had
showed itself as the most real of all realities. It
might be his before another night, before the end
of the present hour. It had come quick enough to
Knutsen. The least resistance to Doomsdorf’s will
would bring it on himself. Many things were lies,
and the false was hard to tell from the true, but in
this regard there was no chance for question.
Doomsdorf would strike the life from him in an
instant at the first hint of revolt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was wholly conceivable that such a thing could
occur. Ned could endure grinding toil till he died;
even such personal abuse as he had received an hour
or so before might find him crushed and unresisting,
but yet there remained certain offenses that
could not be endured. Ned could not forget that
both Lenore and Bess were wholly in Doomsdorf’s
power. A brutal, savage man, it was all too easy
to believe that the time would come soon when he
would forget the half-promise he had given them.
The smoky gaze that he had bent toward Bess
meant, perhaps, that he was already forgetting it.
In that case would there be anything for him but
to fight and die? No matter how great a weakling
he had been, the last mandate of his honor demanded
that. And a bitterness ineffable descended
upon him when he realized that even such bravery
could not in the least help the two girls,—that his
death would be as unavailing and impotent as his
life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How false he had been to himself and his birthright!
He had been living in a fool’s paradise, and
he had fallen from it into hell! Esau sold his birthright
for a mess of pottage: for less return Ned
had sold himself into slavery. He had been a member
of a dominant race, the son of a mighty breed
that wrested the soil from the wilderness and built
strong cities on the desolate plains; but he had
wasted his patrimony of strength and manhood. A
parlor knight, he had leaned upon his father’s sword
rather than learning to wield his own; and he had
fallen vanquished the instant that he had left its
flashing ring of steel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For in this moment of unspeakable remorse, he
found he could blame no one but himself for the
disaster. Every year men traversed these desolate
waters to buy furs from the Indians; he had been
in a staunch boat, and with a little care, a little
foresight, the journey could have been made in perfect
safety. It was a man’s venture, surely; but he
could have carried through if he had met it like a
man instead of a weakling. He knew perfectly
that it was his own recklessness and folly that set
the cups of burning liquor before Captain Knutsen
as he stood at his wheel. It was his own unpardonable
conceit, his own self-sufficiency that made him
start out to meet the North half prepared, daring
to disturb its ancient silences with the sound of his
wild revelry; and to live, in its grim desolation, the
same trivial life he lived at home. He hadn’t even
brought a pistol. Sensing his weakness and his unpreparedness,
Doomsdorf hadn’t even done him the
honor of searching him for one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Knutsen’s death was on his own head: the life of
utter wretchedness and hopelessness and insult that
lay before Lenore and Bess was his own doing, too.
It wouldn’t compensate to die in their defense,
merely leaving them continued helpless prey to
Doomsdorf. He saw now, with this new vision that
had come to him, that his only possible course was
to live and do what he could in atonement. He
mustn’t think of himself any more. All his life he
had thought of nothing but himself; self-love had
been his curse to the end of the chapter,—and now
he could not make himself believe but that it had
been some way intertwined in his love for Lenore.
He would have liked to give himself credit for that,
at least—unselfish devotion, these past years, to
Lenore—but even this stuck in his throat. But
his love for her would be unbiased by self-love now.
He would give all of himself now—holding nothing
back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of his own despair, his own bitter hopelessness,
he must do what he could to keep hope
alive in Lenore and Bess. It was the only chance
he had to pay, even in the most pitiful, slight degree
for what he had done to them. He must always
try to make their lot easier, doing their work when
he could, maintaining an attitude of cheer, living
the lie of hope when hope seemed dead in his breast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned Cornet was awake at last. He knew himself,
his generation, the full enormity of his own
folly, the unredeemed falsehood of his old philosophy.
Better still, he knew what lay before him,
not only the remorselessness of his punishment but
also his atonement: doing willingly and cheerfully
the little he could to lighten the burdens of his innocent
victims. He could have <span class='it'>that</span> to live for, at
least, doing the feeble little that he could. And
that is why, when Doomsdorf looked at him again,
he found him in some way straightened, his
eyes more steadfast, his lips in a firmer, stronger
line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Glad to see you’re bucking up,” he commented
lightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned turned soberly. “I <span class='it'>am</span> bucking up,” he answered.
“I see now that you’ve gone into something
you can’t get away with. Miss Gilbert was
right; in the end you’ll find yourself laid out by
the heels.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It can be said for Ned, for the reality of his
resolve, that his words seemed to ring with conviction,
giving no sign of the utter despair that was
in his heart. Of course he was speaking them for
the ears of Lenore and Bess, in order to encourage
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You think so, eh?” Doomsdorf yawned and
stretched his arms. “Just try something—that’s
all. And since you’re feeling so good, I don’t see
why you shouldn’t get to work. You can still put
in a fairly good morning. And you”—he turned,
with the catlike swiftness that marked so many of
his movements, toward Bess—“what’s your
name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You just heard him say. Miss Gilbert——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can forget you are a ‘Miss.’ You’re a
squaw out here—and can do squaw’s work.
What’s your first name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bess, in her misery, looked at him with dread.
“Bess Gilbert,” she answered quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bess it will be. Lenore, I think you call the
other—and Ned. Good thing to know first names,
since we’ve got an uncertain number of years before
us. Well, I suggest that all three of you go out
and see what you can do about wood. You’ll have
to cut some and split it. I’ve been lazy about laying
in a winter store.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Much to his amazement, Ned stood erect, pulled
down his cap over his brown curls, and buttoned his
coat. “I’ll see what we can do,” he answered
straightforwardly. “I have, though, one thing to
ask.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That you let the two girls take it easy to-day—and
get warmed through. If you sent them out
now, weakened as they are, it might very easily
mean pneumonia and death. It’s to your interest
to keep them alive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s to my interest, surely—but don’t rely on
that to the extent of showing too much independence.
The human body can stand a lot before it
gives up the ghost. The human voice can do a lot
of screaming. I know, because I’ve seen. I don’t
mind running a little risk with human life to get
my way, and I know several things, short of actual
killing, that go toward enforcing obedience and
quelling mutiny.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lenore, staring wildly at him, caught her breath
in a sob. “You don’t mean——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Doomsdorf did not look at her. He still smiled
down at Ned. “You’ve never felt a knout, have
you, on the naked back?” he asked sweetly. “I
found out what they were like in Siberia, and with
the hope of showing some one else, I took one out—in
my boot. It’s half-killed many a man—but
I only know one man that it’s completely killed.
He was a guard—and I found out just how many
blows it takes. You can stop a hundred—fifty—perhaps
only ten before that number, and life still
lingers.” The man yawned again. “But your request
is granted—so far as Lenore is concerned.
You can leave her here for me to entertain. Bess
has spirit enough to talk—she has undoubtedly
spirit enough to work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned, deeply appalled and unspeakably revolted,
looked to Lenore for directions. Her glorious
head was on her arms, and she shook it in utter
misery. “I can’t go out there now,” she said.
“I’ll just die if I do—I’m so cold still, so weakened.
I wish I had died out there in the storm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned turned once more to Doomsdorf. “She’s
telling the truth—I think she simply can’t stand
to go,” he urged gravely. “But though she’s absolutely
in your power, there are some things even a
beast can’t do. You just the same as gave me
your word——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are things a beast can’t do, but I’m not
a beast. There’s nothing I can’t do that I want to
do. I make no promises—just the same, for this
time, I don’t think you need be afraid. I don’t take
everything that comes along in the way of a woman.
I want a woman of thews!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bess dared not look at him, but she felt the insult
of his searching gaze. She buttoned her coat
tight, then stood waiting. An instant later Doomsdorf
was holding the door open for her as she went
to her toil.</p>

<div><h1>XVII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>There</span> were a number of axes in the little work-room
that comprised one end of the long cabin, and
Doomsdorf flung three of them over his shoulder.
“Right up through here,” he urged, pointing to
the little hillside behind the cabin. “Of course I
can’t let you cut fuel from these trees so close to
the house. You, as city people, surely know something
about house beautifying. You’ll have to
carry the wood a little farther—but you won’t
mind, when you know it’s for the sake of beauty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The snow was noticeably deeper in the two hours
since they had come. It clung to Ned’s trouser
legs almost to the knees, soaking through his thin
walking shoes; and both he and Bess found it some
degree of labor just to push through it. Doomsdorf
halted them before one of the half-grown
spruce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here’s a good one,” he commented. “Just beyond
is another. You can each take one—cut
them down with your axes and then hack them into
two-foot lengths for the stove. Better split each
length into three pieces—the larger ones, anyway.
If you have time, you can carry it down to the
cabin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He swung his axes down from his shoulder. He
seemed to be handling them with particular care,
but several seconds elapsed before Ned realized that
the moment had some slight element of drama.
Heretofore he had been unable to observe that
Doomsdorf was in the least on guard against his
prisoners. He had seemingly taken no obvious precautions
in his own defense. It was plain to see,
however, that he did not intend to put axes into
the hands of these two foes until he had one ready
to swing himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took the handle of the largest axe in his right
hand; with his left he extended the other two implements,
blades up, to Ned and Bess. “I suppose
you know we’ve had no experience——” Ned
began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It doesn’t matter. Just be careful the trees
don’t fall on you. They sometimes do, you know,
on amateur woodsmen. The rest is plain brute
strength and awkwardness.” He handed them
each, from his pocket, a piece of dried substance
that looked like bark. “Here’s a piece of jerked
caribou each—it ought to keep life in your bodies.
And the sooner you get your wood cut and split,
the sooner you see any more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he turned and left them to their toil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus began a bitter hour for Ned. He found the
mere work of biting through the thick trunk with
his axe cost him his breath and strained his patience
to the limit. It wasn’t as easy as it looked. He
did not strike true; the blade made irregular white
gashes in the bark; his blows seemed to lack power.
The great, ragged wound deepened but slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally it was half through the trunk, and yet
the tree stood seemingly as sturdy as ever. Reckless
from fatigue, he chopped on more fiercely than
ever. And suddenly, with the grinding noise of
breaking wood, the tree started to fall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And at that instant Ned was face to face with
the exigency of leaping for his life. The tree did
not fall in the direction planned. An instant before,
weary and aching and out of breath, Ned
would have believed himself incapable of swift and
powerful motion. As that young spruce shattered
down toward him, like the club of a giant aimed to
strike out his life, a supernatural power seemed to
snatch him to one side. Without realization of
effort, the needed muscles contracted with startling
force, and he sprang like a distance jumper to
safety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he didn’t jump too soon or too far. The
branches of the tree lashed at him as it descended,
hurling him headlong in the snow. And thereafter
there were three things to cause him thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of them was the attitude of Bess,—the girl
to whom, in weeks past, he had shown hardly decent
courtesy: the same girl whom in childish fury he
had cursed the bitter, eventful night just gone.
Above the roar of the falling tree he heard her
quick, half-strangled gasp of horror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sound seemed to have the qualities that made
toward a perfect after-image; because in the silence
that followed, as he lay in the soft snow, and the
crash of the fallen tree echoed into nothingness, it
still lingered, every tone perfect and clear, in his
mind’s ear. There was no denying its tone of ineffable
dismay. Evidently Bess was of a forgiving
disposition; in spite of his offense of the past night
she had evidently no desire to see him crushed into
jelly under that giant’s blow. Some way, it had
never occurred to him that the girl would harbor
a kind thought for him again. She had been right
and he had been wrong; in an effort to serve him
she had received only his curse, and her present
desperate position, worse perhaps than either his
own or Lenore’s, was due wholly to his own folly.
She had not taken part in the orgy of the night
before, so not the least echo of responsibility could
be put on her. Yet she didn’t hate him. She had
cried out in real agony when she thought he was
about to die.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He thought upon this matter as he lay in the soft
snow whence the descending branches of the tree
had hurled him. He didn’t have many seconds to
think about it. Further eccentricity on the part of
Bess swiftly gave him additional cause for reflection.
She had not only cried out, but she ran to
him with the speed of a deer. She was by his side
almost before he was aware of the scope of the
accident.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sobbing cry he had heard could very likely
be attributed merely to that instinctive horror that
a sensitive girl would feel at an impending tragedy,
wholly apart from personal interest in the victim;
but for a few seconds Ned was absolutely at a loss
to explain that drawn, white, terrified face above
him. In fear for him, Bess was almost at the point
of absolute collapse herself. Nor could mere impersonal
horror explain her flying leap to reach
his side,—like a snowbird over the drifts. It
meant more than mere forgiveness for the terrible
pass to which he had brought her. In a few seconds
of clear thinking he thought he saw the truth: that
even after all that was past Bess still looked to
him for her hope, that she regarded him still as her
defense against Doomsdorf; and that his death
would leave her absolutely bereft. He was a man,
and she still dreamed that he might save her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The result was a quick sense of shame of his own
inadequacy. It is not good to know oneself a failure
in the face of woman’s trust. Yet the effect of
the little scene was largely good, for it served to
strengthen Ned’s resolve to spare the girls in every
way he could, and by his own feigned hope to keep
them from despair. Above all, he found an increased
admiration for Bess. Instead of a silly
prude, a killjoy for the party, she had shown herself
as a sportswoman to the last fiber. She had
been a friend when she had every right to be an
enemy; she had shown spirit and character when
women of lesser metal would have been irremediably
crushed. He was far away now from the old
barriers of caste. There was no reason, on this
barren, dreadful isle, why he shouldn’t accept all
the friendship she would give him and give his own
in return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this subject was only one of three that suddenly
wakened him to increased mental activity.
If he were amazed at Bess, he was no less amazed
at himself. He had been tired out, hopeless, out of
wind, hardly able to swing his arms, and yet he had
managed to leap out of seeming certain death. The
unmistakable inference was that the body in which
his spirit had dwelt for thirty years had strength
and possibilities of which hitherto he had been unaware.
In the second of crisis he had shown a perfect
coördination of brain and muscle, an accuracy
of transmission of the brain-messages that were
conducted along his nerves, and a certain sureness
of instinct that he had never dreamed he possessed.
It would have been very easy to have jumped the
wrong way. Yet he had jumped the right way—the
only possible way to avoid death—choosing
infallibly the nearest point of safety and hurling
himself directly toward it. Perhaps it would have
been better to have stayed where he was, to have
let the tree crush the life out of him and be done
with Hell Isle for good, yet a power beyond himself
had carried him out of danger. The point offered
interesting possibilities. Could it be that he
had had the makings of a man in him all these years
and had never been aware of it? Could he dare
hope that this side of him might be developed, in
the hard years to come, so that he might be better
able to endure the grinding toil and hardship? The
thought wasn’t really <span class='it'>hope</span>—he didn’t believe that
<span class='it'>hope</span> would ever visit him again—it was only an
instant’s rift, dim as twilight, in the gloom of his
despair. The most he could ever hope to do was
to fortify himself in order to take more and more
of the girl’s hardship upon his shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thirdly he gave some thought to the matter of
felling trees. It was a more complex matter than
he had at first supposed. Evidently he had gone
about it in the wrong way. It would pay to have
more respect for the woodsman’s science if he did
not wish to come to an early end beneath a falling
tree. He might not be so quick to dodge again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bess was staring wide-eyed into his face; and he
smiled quietly in reassurance. “Not hurt at all,”
he told her. Quickly he climbed to his feet. “See
that you don’t do the same thing that I did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Delighted that he had not been hurt but a little
aghast at what heart’s secret she might have revealed
in running to his aid, she started to go back
to her toil. But Ned had already reached some
conclusions about tree-felling. He walked with
her to her fallen axe, then inspected the deep cut
she had already made in her tree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re doing the same thing I did, sure
enough,” he observed. “The tree will fall your
way and crush you. Let me think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment later he took his axe and put in a few
more strokes in the same place. It was the danger
point, he thought: a deeper cut might fell the tree
prematurely. Presently he crossed to the opposite
side, signaled Bess out of danger, and began to
hack the tree again, making a cut somewhat above
that started on the other side of the trunk. He
chopped sturdily; and in a moment the tree started
to fall, safely and in an opposite direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He uttered some small sound of triumph; but it
was a real tragedy to have the tree fall against a
near-by tree and lodge. Again he had failed to
exercise proper foresight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was nothing to do but climb into the adjoining
tree with his axe and laboriously cut the
lodged tree away. In the meantime Bess went to
work on the first tree felled, trimming it of its limbs
so to cut it into lengths.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned joined her at the work, but long before the
first tree was cut into fuel, both were at the edge
of utter exhaustion. The point of fatigue he had
reached that morning in rowing, when he had rested
from the sheer inability to take another stroke, was
already far past. There had been a point, some
time back, when every muscle of his body had
throbbed with a burning ache, when pain crept all
over him like a slow fire, but that too was largely
passed now. His brain was dulled; he felt baffled
and estranged as if in a dream. It was more like a
nightmare now,—his axe swinging eternally in his
arms, the chips flying, one after another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He seemed to move so slowly. Hours were passing,
one after another, and still great lengths of
the trees remained to cut and split. But they
couldn’t stop and rest. They dared not return to
the cabin till the work was done: the brute that
was their master would be glad of an excuse to lay
on the lash. They had been taught what mercy to
expect from him. Here was one reality that their
fatigue could not blunt: their cruel master waiting
in the cabin. As the rest of their conscious world
faded and dimmed he was ever more vivid, ever
more real. The time soon came when he filled all
the space in their thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Ned life was suddenly immensely simplified.
All the complexities of his old life had suddenly
ceased to matter: indeed that had perished from
his consciousness. The world was forgotten, he had
no energy to waste in remembering how he had
come hence, even who he was. From the supreme
egoist, knowing no world but that of which his own
ego was the orbit, to a faltering child hardly aware
of his own identity: thus had Ned changed in a
single night. The individual who had been Ned
Cornet had almost ceased to be; and in his place
was a helpless pawn of a cruel and remorseless fate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knew Fate now. Through the mists of this
nightmare that was upon him he saw the Jester
with his bells. And as he looked, the sharp, ironic
face grew savage, brutal, half-covered with blond
hair; the motley became a cap of silver fox. But
this changed too, as his axe swung in the air. Once
more the face was sharp, but still unutterably terrible
to see; but it was livid now, as if sulphurous
flames were playing upon it. And the foot—he
saw the foot plain against the snow. It was unspeakable,
filling him with cold horror all his length.
It was some way cloven and ghastly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The vision passed, broken and dissolved by the
noise of the axe on the tough wood. He knew Fate
now. He had seen him in all his forms. In his
folly he had scorned him, taunted him by his insolence,
had dared to dream that he was greater
than Fate, immune from his persecution. If this
torment ended now, he had paid the price. He had
atoned for everything already if he did not lift the
axe again. Yet only eternity lay ahead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Doomsdorf had seemed almost incredible to him
at first. It was as if he couldn’t possibly be true:
a figment of nightmare that would vanish as soon
as he wakened. But he was real enough now.
Nothing was left to him but the knowledge how real
he was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He must not rest, he must not pause till the work
was done. The fact that Bess had fallen, fainting,
in the snow, did not affect him; he must swing his
axe and hew the wood. Day was dying. Grayness
was creeping in from the sea. It was like the essence
of the sea itself, all gray, gray like his dreams,
gray like the ashes of his hopes. He must finish the
two trees before the darkness came down and kept
him from seeing where to sink the blade. Otherwise
it wouldn’t matter—day or night, one year
or another. Time had ceased to count; seemingly
it had almost ceased to move. But the <span class='it'>knout</span> would
be waiting, hardened and sharp with wire, if he
didn’t do his work. Cold fear laid hold of him
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not know that this cold that was upon
him was not only that of fear. His clothes had
been wet through by perspiration and melted snow,
and now the bitter winds off the sea were getting
to him. Still he swung his axe. It was always
harder to strike true; the tough lengths took
ever more blows to split. The time soon came
when he was no longer aware of the blows against
the wood. The axe swung automatically in his
arms; even sense of effort was gone from him.
The only reality that lived in him now, in that
misty twilight, was the knowledge that he must get
through.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was too dark to see, now, how much of the
work remained. The night was cheating him, after
all. He struck once more at the tough length that
lay at his feet—a piece at which he had already
struck uncounted blows. He gave all his waning
strength to the effort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The length split open, but the axe slipped out
of his bleeding hands, falling somewhere in the
shadows beyond. He must crawl after it; he didn’t
know how many more lengths there were to split.
It was strange that he couldn’t keep his feet. And
how deep and still was the night that dropped over
him!</p>

<p class='pindent'>How long he groped for the axe handle in the
snow he never knew. But he lay still at last. Twilight
deepened about him, and the wind wept like
a ghost risen from the sea. The very flame of his
life was burning down to embers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus it came about that Doomsdorf missed the
sound of his axe against the wood. Swinging a
lantern, a titantic figure among the snow-laden
trees, he tramped down to investigate. Bess, semi-conscious
again, wakened when the lantern light
danced into her eyes. But it took him some little
time to see Ned’s dark form in the snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reason was, it was lying behind a mighty
pile of split fuel. The light showed that only green
branches, too small to be of value, remained of the
two spruce. And Doomsdorf grunted, a wondering
oath, deep in his throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had been faithful slaves. Putting his
mighty arm around them, each in turn, he half carried,
half dragged them into the warmth of the
cabin.</p>

<div><h1>XVIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Ned</span> was spared the misery and despair that
overswept Doomsdorf’s cabin the first night of his
imprisonment. His master dropped him on the
floor by the stove, and there he lay, seemingly without
life, the whole night through. Even the sound
of the wind could not get down into that dim region
of half-coma where he was: he heard neither its
weird chant on the cabin roof, or that eerie, sobbing
song that it made to the sea, seemingly the articulation
of the troubled soul of the universe. He did
not see the snow piling deeper on the window ledge;
nor sit straining in the dreadful, gathering silence
of the Arctic night. The promised reward of food
was not his because he could not get up to take it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet he was not always deeply insensible. Sometimes
he would waken with a knowledge of wracking
pain in his muscles, and sometimes cold would
creep over him. Once he came to himself with the
realization that some one was administering to him.
Soft, gentle hands were removing his wet, outer
garments, rolling him gently over in order to get
at them, slipping off his wet shoes and stockings.
A great tenderness swept over him, and he smiled
wanly in the lantern light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since he was a child, before the world was ever
too much with him, no living human being had seen
him smile in quite this way. It was a smile of utter
simplicity, childishly sweet, and yet brave too,—as
if he were trying to hearten some one who was
distressed about him. He didn’t feel the dropping
tears that were the answer to that smile, nor feel
the heart’s glow, dear beyond all naming, that it
wakened. To the girl who, scarcely able herself
to stand erect, had crept from her warm cot to serve
him, it seemed almost to atone for everything, to
compensate for all she had endured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lenore?” the man whispered feebly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there was no spoken answer out of the
shadow at the edge of the lantern light. Perhaps
there was the faint sound, like a gasp, almost as if
a terrible truth that was for an instant forgotten
had been recalled again; and perhaps the administering
hands halted in their work for one part of
an instant. But at once they continued to ply
about him, so strong and capable, and yet so ineffably
gentle. It couldn’t be Lenore, of course.
No wonder,—Lenore had suffered grievously
from the events of the past night. In his half-delirium
it occurred to him that it might be his mother.
There had been times in the past, when his mother
had come to his bedside in this same way, with this
same gentleness, during his boyhood sicknesses.
But he couldn’t remain awake to think about it.
His wet, clinging clothes had been removed, and
blankets, already warmed, were being wrapped
about him. He fell into deep, restful sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it ended all too soon. A great hand shook
him, snatching him into a sitting position, and a
great, bearded face, unspeakably terrible in the
weird, yellow light of the lantern, showed close to
his own. “Up and out,” he was shouting. “It’ll
be light enough to work by the time you have breakfast.
Out before I boot you out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He meant what he said. Already his cruel boot
was drawn back. Ned’s conscious world returned
to him in one mighty sweep, like a cruel, white light
bursting upon tired eyes. The full dreadfulness
of his lot, forgotten in his hours of sleep, was recalled
more vividly than ever. It wasn’t just a
dream, to be dispersed on wakening. Even yesterday’s
blessed murk of unreality, dimming everything
and dulling all his perceptions, was gone now
that he was refreshed by sleep. His brain worked
clear, and he saw all things as they were. And the
black wall of hopelessness seemed unbroken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet instantly he remembered Lenore. At least
he must continue to try to shelter her—even to
make conditions easy as possible for Bess. His
love for the former was the one happiness of his
past life that he had left; and he didn’t forget his
obligation to the latter. Bess was already up,
building up the fire at Doomsdorf’s command, but
Lenore, with whom she had slept, still lay sobbing
on her cot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned pulled on his clothes, scarcely wondering
at the fact that they were hanging, miraculously
dry, back of the stove; and immediately hurried to
Lenore’s side. He forgot his own aching muscles
in distress for her; and his arms went about her,
drawing her face to his own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my girl, you mustn’t cry,” he told her, with
a world of compassion in his tone. “I’ll take care
of you. Don’t you know I will——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But with tragic face Lenore drew back from his
arms. “<span class='it'>How</span> can you take care of me?” she asked
with immeasurable bitterness. “Can you stand
against that brute——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush——!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course you can’t. You’re even afraid to
speak his name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my dear! Don’t draw away.” The man’s
voice was pleading. “I was just afraid he’d take
some awful punishment from you. Of course I’m
helpless now——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then how can you take care of me?” she demanded
again, for a moment forgetting her despair
in her anger at him. “Can you make him let me
stay in bed, instead of going out to die in this awful
snow? Death—that’s all there’s here for me.
And the quicker it comes the better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sobbed again, and he tried in vain to comfort
her. “We’ll come through,” he whispered. “I’ll
make everything as light as I can——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she thrust off his caressing hands. “I don’t
want you to touch me,” she told him tragically.
“You can’t make things light for me, in this living
hell. And until you can protect me from that man,
and save me, you can keep your kisses. Oh, why
did you ever bring me here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose—because I loved you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You showed it, in taking me into this awful
land in an unsafe boat. You can keep your love.
I wish I’d never seen you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just a moment his hands dropped to his sides,
and he showed her the white, drawn visage of utter
despair. Yet he must not hold these words against
her. Surely she had cause for them; perhaps she
would find him some tenderness when she saw how
hard he had tried to serve her, to ease her lot. Her
last words recalled his own that he had spoken to
Bess aboard the <span class='it'>Charon</span>: if he had railed as he had to
Bess for such little cause, at least he must not blame
Lenore, even considering the fact of their love, in
such a moment as this. He <span class='it'>had</span> brought her from
her home and to this pass. Save for him, she would
be safe in her native city, not a slave to an inhuman
master on this godless island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked down at her steadfastly. “I can’t
keep my love,” he told her earnestly. “I gave it
to you long ago, and it’s yours still. That love is
the one thing I have left to live for here; the one
thing that’s left of my old life. I’m going to continue
to watch over you, to help you all I can, to
do as much of your work as possible; to stand between
you and Doomsdorf with my own life. I’ve
learned, in this last day, that love is a spar to cling
to when everything else is lost, the most important
and the greatest blessing of all. And I’m not going
to stop loving you, whether you want me to or not.
I’m going to fight for you—to the end.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And in the end I’ll die,” she commented bitterly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Doomsdorf reëntered the room then, gazing at
them in amused contempt, and Ned instinctively
straightened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I trust you’re not hatching mutiny?” the sardonic
voice came out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not just now,” Ned answered with some spirit.
“There’s not much use to hatch mutiny, things being
as they are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t say! There’s a rifle on the
wall——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Always empty——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the pistol I carry is always loaded. Why
don’t you try to take it away from me?” Then his
voice changed, surly and rumbling again. “But
enough of that nonsense. You know what would
happen to you if you tried anything—I’ve told
you that already. There’s work to do to-day.
There’s got to be another cabin—logs cut, built
up, roof put on—a place for the three of you to
bunk. That’s the work to-day. The three of you
ought to get a big piece of it done to-day——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Hardenworth? Is she well enough?
Couldn’t she help your wife with the housework
to-day?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will take all three of you to do the work I’ll
lay out. Lenore can learn to do her stint with the
others. And hereafter, when you address me, call
me ‘Sir.’ A mere matter of employer’s discipline——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Because he knew his master, Ned nodded in
agreement. “Yes, sir,” he returned simply.
“One thing else. I can’t be expected to do real
work in this kind of clothes. You’ve laid out furs
and skins for the girls; I want to get something too
that will keep me warm and dry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not responsible for the clothes you brought
with you. You should have had greater respect for
the North. Besides, it gives me pleasure, I assure
you, to see you dressed as you are. It tones up the
whole party.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stripped of his late conceit that might otherwise
have concealed it from him, Ned caught every vestige
of the man’s irony. “Do I get the warm
clothes?” he demanded bluntly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When you earn them,” was the answer. “In
a few days more you’ll be running out your traps,
and everything you catch, at first, you can keep.
You’ve got to prove yourself smarter than the animals
before you get the right to wear their skins.”</p>

<div><h1>XIX</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> previous day and night had been full of
revelation for Ned; and as he started forth from
the cabin with his axe, there occurred a little scene
that tended even further to illustrate his changing
viewpoint. Gloating with triumph at the younger
man’s subjection, Doomsdorf called sardonically
from the cabin doorway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I trust I can’t help you in any way?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Discerning the premeditated insult in his tone,
Ned whirled to face him. Then for an instant he
stood shivering with wrath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he answered. His promise to say “sir”
was forgotten in his rage. “You can at least treat
me with the respect deserved by a good workman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The words came naturally to his lips. It was as
if they reflected a thought that he had considered
long, instead of the inspiration of the moment.
The truth was that, four days before, he had never
known that good work and good workmen were
entitled to respect. The world’s labor had seemed
apart from his life; the subject a stupid one not
worth his thought and interest. In one terrible day
Ned had found out what the word work meant.
He had learned what a reality it was. All at once
he saw in it a possible answer to life itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood aghast at the magnitude of his discovery.
Why, <span class='it'>work</span> was the beginning and the end of
everything. Reaching back to the beginnings of
creation, extending clear until the last soul in
heaven had passed on and through the training
camp of the last hereafter, it was the thing that
counted most. He had never thought about it in
particular before. Strangely it had not even occurred
to him that the civilization that he worshipped,
all the luxury and richness that he loved,
had been possible only through the toil of human
hands and brains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly he knew that his father had been right
and he had been wrong. The life of the humblest
worker had been worth more than his. It would
have been better for him to die, that long-ago night
of the automobile accident, than for Bess to lose
one of her working hands! He had been contemptuous
of work and workers, but had not his own
assumption of superiority been chiefly based upon
the achievements of working men who had gone before
him? What could he claim for himself that
could even put him on the par with the great mass
of manhood, much less make him their superior?
He had played when there was work to do,
shirked his load when the backs of better men were
bent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his heart Ned had been a little ashamed of
his father. He had felt it would have been more
to his credit if the wealth that sustained him should
have originated several generations farther back,
instead of by the sole efforts of Godfrey Cornet.
It had made Ned himself feel almost like one of
the <span class='it'>nouveaux riches</span>. The more the blood of success
was thinned, it seemed, the bluer it was; and it
wasn’t easy to confess, especially to certain young
English bloods, that the name emblazoned in electric
lights across a great house of trade was, but one
generation removed, his own. He had particularly
deplored his father’s tendency to mention, in any
company, his own early struggles, the poverty from
which he sprung. But how true and genuine was
the shame he felt now at that false shame! In this
moment of revelation he saw his father plainly and
knew him for the sturdy old warrior, the man of
prowess, most of all for the sterling aristocrat that
he was. He was a good workman: need anything
more be said?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ever since his college days he had snubbed him,
patronized him, disregarded his teachings whereby
he might have come into his own manhood. He had
never respected good work or good workmen; and
now it was fitting retribution that he should spend
his natural life in the most grinding, bitter work.
Even now he was making amends for his folly at
the hands of the most cruel, ironical fate that could
befall him. His axe was in his arms; his savage
taskmaster faced him from the cabin doorway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All these thoughts coursed through Ned’s keenly
wakened brain in an instant. They seemed as instantaneous
as the flood of wrath that had swept
through him at Doomsdorf’s irony. And now
would he suffer some unspeakable punishment for
insolence to his master?</p>

<p class='pindent'>But little, amused lines came about Doomsdorf’s
fierce eyes. “A good workman, eh?” he echoed.
“Yes, you did work fair enough yesterday. Wait
just a minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned into his door, in a moment reappearing
with a saw and several iron wedges from among
his supplies of tools. He put them in Ned’s hands,
and the latter received them with a delight never
experienced at any favor of fortune in the past.
The great penalty of such a life as he had lived,
wherein almost every material thing came into his
hands at his wish, is that it costs the power to feel
delight, the simple joy and gratitude of children;
but evidently Ned was learning how again. Just
a saw of steel and wedges of iron for splitting!
Workmen’s tools that he once regarded with contempt.
But oh, they would save him many a weary
hour of labor. The saw could cut through the
fallen logs in half the time he could hack them with
his axe; they could be split in half the number of
strokes with the aid of the wedges.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went to his toil; and he was a little amazed
at how quickly he felled the first of the tall spruce.
Seemingly his yesterday’s toil had bestowed upon
him certain valuable knowledge. His strokes
seemed to be more true: they even had a greater
degree of power for the same amount of effort.
There were certain angles by which he could get the
best results: he would learn them, too—sooner or
later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he worked, the stiffness and pain that yesterday’s
toil had left in his muscles seemed to pass
away. The axe swung easily in his arms. When
the first tree was chopped down, he set Lenore and
Bess at trimming off the branches and sawing
twelve-foot logs for the hut.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It came about that he chopped down several trees
before the two girls had finished cutting and trimming
the first. Seemingly Lenore had not yet recovered
from the trying experience of two nights
before, for she wholly failed to do any part of the
work. What was done at this end of the labor Bess
did alone. The unmistakable inference was that
Ned would have to double his own speed in order
to avoid the lash at night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet he felt no resentment. Lenore was even
more inured to luxury and ease than he himself:
evidently the grinding physical labor was infinitely
beyond her. Bess, however, still toiled bravely with
axe and saw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day turned out to be not greatly different
from the one preceding. Again Ned worked to
absolute exhaustion: the only apparent change
seemed to be that he accomplished a greater amount
of work before he finally fell insensible in the snow.
This was the twilight hour, and prone in the snow
he lay like a warrior among his fallen. About him
was a ring of trees chopped down and, with Bess’s
aid, trimmed of their limbs, notched and sawed into
lengths for the cabin. They had only to be lifted,
one upon another, to form the cabin walls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bess had collapsed too as the twilight hour drew
on; and Lenore alone was able to walk unaided to
the shack. Again Ned lay insensible on the floor
beside the stove, but to-night, long past the supper
hour, he was able to remove his own wet clothes and
to devour some of the unsavory left-overs from the
meal. Again the night fell over Hell Island,
tremulous and throbbing with all the mighty passions
of the wild, and again dawn came with its
gray light on the snow. And like some insensible,
mechanical thing Ned rose to toil again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The third day was given to lifting the great logs,
one upon another, for the walls of the cabin. It
was, in reality, the hardest work he had yet done,
as to shift each log into place took every ounce of
lifting power the man had. The girls could help
him but little here, for both of them together did
not seem to be able to handle an end of the great
logs. He found he had to lift each end in turn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet he was able to drag to the cabin to-night,
and torpid with fatigue, take his place at the crude
supper table. He was hardly conscious that he was
eating—lifting the food to his mouth as mechanically
as he had lifted the great logs into place toward
the end of the day—and the faces opposite
him were as those seen in a dream, never in the full
light, vague and dim like ghosts. Sometimes he
tried to smile at one of them—as if by a long-remembered
instinct—and sometimes one of the assembled
group—a different face than that to
which he addressed his smiles—seemed to be smiling
at him, deep-blue eyes curiously lustrous as if
with tears. Then there was a brown, inscrutable
face that just now and then appeared out of the
shadow, and a stealing, slipping, silent some one
that belonged to it,—some one that now and then
brought food and put it on the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But none of these faces went home to him like
the great, hairy visage of the demon that sat opposite.
Ned eyed him covertly throughout the
meal, wondering every time he moved in his chair
if he were getting up to procure his whip, flinching
every time the great arm moved swiftly across
the table. He didn’t remember getting up from
his chair, stripping off part of his wet clothes and
falling among the blankets that Doomsdorf had left
for his use on the floor. Almost at once it was
dawn again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A new, more vivid consciousness was upon him
when he wakened. The stabbing ache in his legs
and arms was mostly worn off now; but there was
a sharp pain in the small of his back that at first
seemed absolutely unendurable. But it wailed, too,
as he went to the work of finishing the cabin, laying
the roof and hanging the crude door. To-day he
was conscious of greater physical power, of more
prolonged effort without fatigue. The whole island
world was more vivid and clear than ever before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was with a certain vague quality of pleasure
that he regarded this cabin he had built with his
own hands, finished now, except for the chinking
of the logs. It was the first creative work he had
ever done, and he looked at it and saw that it was
good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could forget, now, the dreadful, heart-breaking
toil he had put into it. It had almost killed
him, but he was no worse for it now. Indeed his
arms were somewhat stronger, he was even better
equipped to meet the next, greater task that
Doomsdorf appointed him. It was curious that,
slave of a cruel taskmaster that he was, he experienced
a dim echo of something that was akin to a
new self-respect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These logs, laid one upon another, were visible
proof that so far he had stood the gaff! He had
done killing work, yet he still lived to do more. The
fear that his spirit would fly from his exhausted
frame at the end of one of these bitter days could
soon be discarded; seemingly he could toil from
dawn to dark, eat his fill, and in a night’s sleep
build himself up for another day of toil. More and
more of Lenore’s work could be laid on his ever-strengthening
shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cabin itself was roomy and snug: here he
could find seclusion from Doomsdorf and his imperturbable
squaw. It was blessing enough just to
be out of his sight in the long winter nights after
supper, no more to watch every movement of his
arm! Besides, he was down to realities, and it was
a mighty satisfaction to know that here was a lasting
shelter from the storm and the cold. The
Arctic winter was falling swiftly, and here was his
defense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Doomsdorf gave him a rusted, discarded stove;
and it was almost joy to see it standing in its place!
With Doomsdorf’s permission, he devoted a full
day to procuring fuel for it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Four days more the three of them worked at the
task of laying in fuel,—Ned doing the lion’s share
of the work, of course; Bess toiling to the limit of
her fine, young strength; Lenore making the merest
pretense. The result of the latter’s idleness was,
of course, that her two companions had to divide
her share of work between them. Every day
Doomsdorf allotted them certain duties,—so many
trees to cut up into stove wood, or some other, no
less arduous duty; and he seemed to have an uncanny
ability to drive them just short of actual,
complete exhaustion. The fact that Lenore
shirked her share meant that at the close of every
day, in order to complete the allotment provided,
Ned and Bess had to drive themselves beyond that
point, practically to the border of utter collapse.
The short rests that they might otherwise have allowed
themselves, those blessed moments of relaxation
wherein the run-down batteries of their energy
were recharged, they dared not take. The result
was hour upon hour of such sustained toil that it
seemed impossible that human frames could bear
the strain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the seemingly impossible came to pass, and
every day found them stronger for their tasks.
Evidently the human body has incredible powers
of adaptation to new environment. While, at the
end of the day’s toil, it seemed beyond all possibility
that they could ever stagger back to the cabins,
when the only wish they had left was to lie still in
the snow and let the bitter cold take its toll, yet a
few minutes’ relaxation in the warmth of the stove
always heartened them and gave them strength to
take their places at the supper table. As the days
passed, it was no longer necessary to seek their cots
the instant they left the table. They took to lingering
a little while in the crude chairs about the stove,
mostly sitting silent in absolute dejection, but
sometimes exchanging a few, primitive thoughts.
Very little mattered to them now but food and
shelter and sleep. They were down to the absolute
essentials. As the days passed, however, they began
to take time for primitive, personal toilets.
They took to washing their faces and hands: Bess
and Lenore even combed out the snarls in their hair
with Doomsdorf’s broken comb. Then the two girls
dressed their tresses into two heavy braids, to be
worn Indian fashion in front of the shoulders, the
method that required the least degree of care.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They consumed great quantities of food,—particularly
Bess and Ned. What would have been a
full day’s rations in their own home, enough concentrated
nutriment to put them in bed with indigestion,
did not suffice for a single meal. Never
before had Ned really known the love of food—red
meat, the fair, good bread, rice grains white
and fluffed—but it came upon him quickly enough
now. Before, his choice had run toward women’s
foods, exotic sauces, salads and ices and relishes,
foods that tickled the palate but gave no joy to the
inner man; but now he wanted inner fuel, plenty
of it and unadorned. He cared little how it was
cooked, whether or not it had seasoning. The sweet
taste of meat was loved by him now,—great, thick,
half-done steaks of nutritious caribou. He didn’t
miss butter on his bread. He would eat till he
could hold no more, hardly chewing his food; and
as he lay asleep, the inner agents of his body would
draw from it the stuff of life with which was built
up his shattered tissue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The physical change was manifest in a few days.
His spare flesh went away as if in a single night,
and then hard muscle began to take its place. His
flesh looked firmer; sagging fat was gone from his
face; his skin—pasty white before—was brownish-red
from the scourge of the wind. Now the
manly hair began to mat about his lips and jowls.
A hardening manifested itself in his speech. The
few primitive sentences, spoken in the tired-out
sessions about the stove, became him more than
hours of his former chatter. He no longer gabbled
lightly like a girl, his speech full of quirks and affectations:
he spoke in blunt, short sentences, with
blunt, short words, and his meaning was immediately
plain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was standing the gaff! Every day found
him with greater physical mastery. Yet it was not
altogether innate strength, or simple chemical
energy derived from the enormous quantities of
food he consumed that kept him on his feet. More
than once, as the bitter night came down to find
him toiling, a strange, wan figure in the snow, he
was all but ready to give up. The physical side of
him was conquered; the primitive desire for life no
longer manifested itself in his spirit. Just to fall
in the snow, to let his tired legs wilt under him,
perhaps to creep a little way back into the thicket
where Doomsdorf’s lantern would fail to reveal
him: then he would be free of this dreadful training
camp for good! The sleep that would come
upon him then would not be cursed with the knowledge
of a coming dawn, as gray and hopeless as the
twilight just departed! He would be safe then from
Doomsdorf’s lash! The Arctic wind would convey
his wretched spirit far beyond the madman’s power
to follow; his aching, bleeding hands would heal in
some Gentleness far away. The fear of which
psychologists speak, that of the leap into darkness
that is glibly said to be the last conscious instinct,
was absolutely absent. Death was a word to conjure
with no more. It was no harder for him to
think of than the fall of a tree beneath his axe.
The terror that surrounded it was ever only a
specter: and in the clear vision that came to him
in those terrible twilights, only realities were worth
the effort of thought. The physical torture of staggering
through the snow back to the cabin was so
infinitely worse than any conception that he could
retain of death; the life that stretched before him
was so absolutely bereft of hope that the elemental
dread of what lay beyond would not have restrained
him an instant. The thing went deeper than that.
The reason why he did not yield to the almost irresistible
desire to lie down and let the North take
its toll had its fount in the secret places of the man’s
soul. He was beyond the reach of fear for himself,
but his love for Lenore mastered him yet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He must not leave Lenore. He had given his
love to her, and this love was a thousand times more
compelling than any fear could possibly be. He
must stand up, he must go on through,—for the
sake of this dream that counted more than life.
Was not her happiness in his whole charge? Did
he not constitute her one defense against Doomsdorf’s
persecutions? He must live on, carrying as
many of her burdens as he could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bess too knew an urge beyond herself; but she
would not have found it so easy to get it into concrete
thought. Perhaps women care less about
<span class='it'>cause</span> and more about <span class='it'>effect</span>, willing to follow impulse
and scarcely feeling the need of justifying
every action with a laborious thought process. In
her own heart Bess knew she must not falter, she
must not give up. Whence that knowledge came
she had no idea, and she didn’t care. There was
need of her too on this wretched, windy island.
She had her place here; certain obligations had
been imposed upon her. She didn’t try to puzzle
out what these obligations were. Perhaps she was
afraid of the heart’s secret that might be revealed
to her. Her instinct was simply to stay and play
her part.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The only one of the three to whom the fear of
death was still a reality was Lenore, simply because
the full horror of the island had not yet gone
home to her. She thought she knew the worst; in
reality, she had no inkling of it. So far Ned had
succeeded in sheltering her from it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How long he could continue to do so, in any perceptible
degree, he did not know. In the first place
he had the girl herself to contend with: now that
she was recovering, Lenore would likely enough insist
on doing her own share of the work. Besides,
the problem was greatly complicated, now that the
winter’s supply of fuel was laid by, and the real
season’s activities about to begin. Could he spare
her such bitter, terrible hours that he and Bess must
endure, following the trap lines over the wild?
Must she be cursed and lashed and tortured by the
cold, know the torment of worn-out muscles, only
to be rewarded by the knout for failing to bring in
a sufficient catch of furs? Doomsdorf would be
more exacting, rather than more lenient, in these
months to come. He had been willing enough for
Ned to do Lenore’s share in the work of laying in
winter fuel; but the size of the fur catch was a matter
of greater moment to him. It was unthinkable
that Ned could handle to the best advantage both
Lenore’s trap line and his own. Work as hard as
he might, long into the night hours, one man
couldn’t possibly return two men’s catch. For Lenore’s
sake Ned regarded the beginning of the trapping
season with dread, although for himself he had
cause to anticipate it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hadn’t forgotten that the first furs taken
would be his, and he needed them sorely enough.
Indeed, the matter was beginning to be of paramount
importance to his health and life. The
clothes he had worn from the <span class='it'>Charon</span>, flimsy as the
life of which they had been a part, were rapidly
wearing out. They didn’t turn the rain, and they
were not nearly warm enough for the bitter weather
to come. Ned did not forget that the month was
only October; that according to Doomsdorf, real
winter would not break over them for a few weeks,
at least. The snow flurries, the frost, the bitter
nights were just the merest hint of what was to
come, he said: the wail of the biting wind at night
just the far-off trumpet call of an advancing
enemy. A man could go thinly garbed on such
days as this and, except for an aching chill throughout
his frame, suffer no disagreeable consequences;
but such wouldn’t hold true in the forty-below-zero
weather that impended. Only fur and the thickest
woolens could avail in the months to come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Besides, the trapper’s life offered more of interest
than that of the woodchopper. It would
carry him through those gray valleys and over the
rugged hills that now, when he had time to look
about him, seemed to invite his exploration. Best
of all, the work would largely carry him away from
Doomsdorf’s presence. If only he could spare Lenore,
not only by permission of Doomsdorf but by
the consent of the girl herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The matter came up that night while Doomsdorf
was sorting out some of his smaller traps.
“We’ll light out to-morrow,” he said. “The
sooner we get these things set, the better. The
water furs seem to be absolutely prime already—I’m
sure the land furs must be too. I wonder if
you three have any idea what you’re going to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned saw an opportunity to speak for Lenore, but
Doomsdorf’s speech ran on before he could take it.
“I don’t suppose you do,” he said. “Of course,
I’m going to show you—nevertheless it would help
some if any of you knew an otter from a lynx.
You may not know it, but this island contains a
good many square miles—to trap it systematically
requires many lines and hundreds of traps. I’ve
already laid out three lines—sometimes I’ve
trapped one, and sometimes another. Two of ’em
are four-day lines, and one a five-day line—that
is, they take four and five days respectively to get
around. On each one I’ve built series of huts, or
shacks, all of them with a stove and supplies of
food, and you put up in them for the night. They
are a day’s march apart, giving you time to pick
up your skins, reset, and so on, as you go. Believe
me, you won’t have any time to loaf. After you
get into the cabins at night, eat your supper and
get some of the frost out of your blood, you’ll enjoy
thawing out and skinning the animals you’ve caught
in your trap. If it’s a big animal, dead and frozen
and too big to carry, you’ll have to make a fire out
in the snow and thaw him out there. So you see
you’ll have varied experience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll be away from me and this cabin for days
at a time, but if you’re figuring on any advantage
from that, just put it out of your mind, the sooner
the better. Maybe you think you can sneak enough
time to make a boat, smuggle it down to the water,
and cast off. Let me assure you you’ll have no
time to sneak. Besides, this patch of timber right
here is nearer to the shore than any other patch on
the island—you’d simply have no chance to get
away with it. If you think you could cross the ice
to Tzar Island, after winter breaks, you’re barking
up the wrong tree too. In my daily hunts I’ll manage
to get up on one of these ridges, and I can keep
a pretty fair watch of you over these treeless hills.
You’d never get more than a few hours’ start; and
they wouldn’t help you at all on the ice fields! I
trust there’s no need to mention penalties. You
already know about that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And maybe you are thinking it will be easy
enough to slack—not trying to catch much, so you
won’t have many skins to flesh and stretch—maybe
hiding what you do catch. I’ll just say this. I
have a pretty good idea how this country runs—just
how many skins each line yields with fair trapping.
I’m going to increase that estimate by
twenty per cent.—and that’s to be your minimum.
I won’t say what that amount is now. But if at
the end of the season you’re short—by one skin—look
out! It means that you’ll have to be about
twenty per cent. smarter and more industrious than
the average trapper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But man——” Ned protested. “We’re not
experienced——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll learn quick enough. Aren’t you the
dominant race? And I warn you again—you’d
better drop bitter tears every time you find where
a wolverine has been along and eaten an ermine out
of a trap!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man was not jesting. They knew him well
enough by now; the piercing glitter of his keen,
gray eyes, the odd fixation about his pupils that was
always manifest when he was most in earnest, was
plainly in evidence now. Thus it was with the most
profound amazement that Lenore’s companions
suddenly saw her beautiful mouth curling in a
smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For themselves they were lost in despair. All
too plainly Doomsdorf had merely hinted at the
cruel rigors of the trapper’s trail. Yet Lenore was
smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Ned saw, with a queer little tug of his
heart, that the smile was not meant for him. It
was not a gracious signal of her love, meant to encourage
him in his despair. A woman herself, and
understanding women, Bess never dreamed for an
instant that it was; she knew only too well the
thought and the aim behind that sudden, dazzling
sunshine in Lenore’s face. Yet her only reaction,
beyond amazement, was a swift surge of tenderness
and pity for Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lenore was smiling at Doomsdorf. She was
looking straight into his gray eyes. Her cheeks
were flushed a lovely pink; her eyes were smiling
too; she presented an image of ineffable beauty.
That was what hurt worse,—the fact that her
beauty had never seemed more genuine than now.
It was the mask of falsehood, yet her smile was as
radiant as any he remembered of their most holy
moments together. He had not dreamed that any
emotion except her love for him could call such a
light into her face. It had been, to him, the lasting
proof that she was his, the very symbol of the ideal
of integrity and genuineness that he made of her;
yet now he saw her use it as a wile to win some
favor from this beast in human form. The very
sacredness of their relations was somehow questioned.
The tower of his faith seemed to be tottering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet he forced away the dismay that seemed to
cloud him, then began to watch with keenest interest.
Not even this man of iron could wholly resist
her smile. In a single instant she had captured
his mood: he was not so fixed in his intent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid I wouldn’t be much good to you, as
a trapper,” she began quietly, her voice of cloying
sweetness. “I’m afraid I’d only get in the way
and scare the little—ermines, you call them?—out
of the country. Mr. Doomsdorf, do you know
how well I can keep house?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Doomsdorf looked at her, grinning in contempt,
yet not wholly unresponsive to the call she was
making to him. “Can’t say as I do——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t know how I can cook, either,—make
salads, and desserts, and things like that.
You’d better let me stay here and help your wife
with the housework. I’d really be of some value,
then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For an instant the wind seemed to pause on the
roof; and all of them sat in startled silence. The
only movement was that of Sindy, imperturbable
as ever, rocking back and forth in her chair; and
the sound she made had a slow and regular cadence,
as of a great clock. Ned sat staring at his hands;
Bess’s gaze rested first on him, then on the two
principals of the little drama who still sat smiling
as if in understanding. Ned needn’t have worried
about Lenore insisting on doing her share of the
rigorous, outdoor work. The difficulty that he had
anticipated in persuading her to let him lighten her
burdens had not been serious, after all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And really there was little cause for his own depression.
Lenore meant exactly what she said.
After all, this was his own plan,—that she should
remain and help Sindy with the housework and the
caring for such skins as Doomsdorf himself took,
thus avoiding the heart-breaking hardship of the
trap lines. Nor could he hold against her the lie
in her smile. It was her whole right to use it in her
own behalf: to use any wile she could to gain her
ends. He was a fool to suppose that there was a
moral issue involved! The old moral teaching
against compromise with the devil didn’t hold here.
Perhaps Bess and himself could get farther, make
their toil easier, if they also fawned on Doomsdorf.
The fact that he would sooner wear his hands to
the bone or die beneath the lash did not imply moral
superiority. It simply showed that he was of different
make-up. The same with Bess; she was
simply of a different breed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the wile was not without results. The usual
scoffing refusal did not come at once to the bearded
lips. Perhaps her master was flattered that Lenore
was so tamed, perhaps he wished to reward her
attitude of friendliness so that Bess might take example.
Lenore had never moved him with the same
fire as Bess: perhaps by showing leniency now, the
latter could be brought to this same pass! Besides,
Lenore was the weakest of the three and he had
thus less desire to break what little spirit she had,
rather preferring, by complying with her request,
to heap fresh burdens of toil and hardship on these
two proud-spirited ones before him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You want to stay here with Sindy and me,
eh?” he commented at last. “Well, Sindy might
like some help. I’m willing—but I’ll leave it up
to your two friends. They’ll have to work all the
harder to make up for it—especially Bess. I was
going to have you two girls work together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He watched Ned’s face with keenest interest.
The younger man flushed in his earnestness, his
adoring gaze on Lenore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m only too glad to make it easier for you,”
he said, his crooked, boyish smile dim at his lips.
“That’s the one thing that matters—to help you
all I can. In this case, though—Bess is the one
to say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lenore perceptibly stiffened as Ned’s gaze
turned to Bess. It didn’t flatter her that her lover
should even take Bess into his consideration. She
had grown accustomed to receiving his every duty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it came about that Lenore and her little
jealousies did not even find a place in Bess’s
thought. She returned Ned’s gaze, her eyes lustrous
as if with tears, and she understood wholly
the prayer that was in his heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course she may stay here,” she said.
“We’ll make out somehow.”</p>

<div><h1>XX</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Doomsdorf’s</span> trap lines lay in great circles, coinciding
at various points in order to reduce the number
of cabins needed to work them, and ultimately
swinging back to the home cabin in the thicket beside
the sea. They were very simple to follow, he
explained—Bess’s line running up the river to the
mouth of a great tributary that flowed from the
south, the camp being known as the Eagle Creek
cabin; thence up the tributary to its forks, known
as the Forks cabin, up the left-hand forks to its
mother springs, the Spring cabin, and then straight
down the ridge to the home cabin, four days’ journey
in all. She couldn’t miss any of the three huts,
Doomsdorf explained, as all of them were located
in the open barrens, on the banks of the creeks she
was told to follow. Doomsdorf drew for her guidance
a simple map that would remove all danger
of going astray.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned’s route was slightly more complicated, yet
nothing that the veriest greenhorn could not follow.
It took him first to what Doomsdorf called his
Twelve-Mile cabin at the very head of the little
stream on which the home cabin was built, thence
following a well-blazed trail along an extensive
though narrow strip of timber, a favorable country
for marten, to the top of the ridge, around the
glacier, and down to the hut that Bess occupied
the third night out, known as the Forks cabin;
thence up the right-hand fork to its mother spring,
the Thirty-Mile cabin; over the ridge and down to
the sea, the Sea cabin; and thence, trapping salt-water
mink and otter, to the home cabin, five days’
journey in all. “If you use your head, you can’t
get off,” Doomsdorf explained. “If you don’t, no
one will ever take the trouble to look you up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As if smiling upon their venture, nature gave
them a clear dawn in which to start forth. The
squaw and Bess started up from the river mouth
together, the former in the rôle of teacher; Ned
and Doomsdorf followed up the little, silvery creek
that rippled past the home cabin. And for the first
time since his landing on Hell Island Ned had a
chance really to look about him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the first time he had been out of sight of
the cabin and thus away from the intangible change
that the mere presence of man works on the wild.
All at once, as the last vestige of the white roof
was concealed behind the snow-laden branches of
the spruce, he found himself in the very heart of
the wilderness. It was as if he had passed from one
world to another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even the air was different. It stirred and moved
and throbbed in a way he couldn’t name, as if
mighty, unnamable passions seemed about to be
wakened. He caught a sense of a resistless power
that could crush him to earth at a whim, of vast
forces moving by fixed, invisible law; he felt that
secret, wondering awe which to the woodsman
means the nearing presence of the Red Gods. Only
the mighty powers of nature were in dominion here:
the lashing snows of winter, the bitter cold, the wind
that wept by unheard by human ears. Ned was
closer to the heart of nature, and thus to the heart
of life, than he had ever been before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had no words to express the mood that came
upon him. The wind that crept through the
stunted spruce trees expressed it better than he;
it was in the song that the wolf pack rings to sing
on winter nights; in the weird complaint that the
wild geese called down from the clouds. What little
sound there was, murmuring branches and fallen
aspen leaves, fresh on the snow, rustling faintly together
and serving only to accentuate the depth of
the silence, had this same, eerie motif,—nothing
that could be put in words, nothing that ever came
vividly into his consciousness, but which laid bare
the very soul and spirit of life. Cold and hunger,
an ancient persecution whose reason no man knew,
a never-to-be-forgotten fear of a just but ruthless
God!</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was the land untamed. There was not, at
first, a blaze on a tree, the least sign that human
beings had ever passed that way before. It was the
land-that-used-to-be, unchanged seemingly since
the dim beginnings of the world. Blessed by the
climbing sun of spring, warm and gentle in the summer,
moaning its old complaint when the fall winds
swept through the branches, lashed by the storms
of winter,—thus it had lain a thousand-thousand
years. And now, a little way up the stream, there
was more tangible sign that this was the kingdom
of the wild. Instead of an unpeopled desert, it was
shown to be teeming with life. They began to see
the trails of the forest creatures in the snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes they paused before the delicate imprint
of a fox, like a snow etching made by a master
hand; sometimes the double track of marten and
his lesser cousin, the ermine; once the great cowlike
mark of a caribou, seeking the pale-green reindeer
moss that hung like tresses from the trees. Seemingly
every kind of northern animal of which Ned
had ever heard had immediately preceded them
through the glade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where there’s timber, there’s marten,” Doomsdorf
explained. “Marten, I suppose you know,
are the most valuable furs we take, outside of silver
and blue fox—and one of the easiest taken. The
marten’s such a ruthless hunter that he doesn’t look
what he’s running into. You won’t find them far
on the open barrens, but they are in hundreds in the
long, narrow timber belt between Twelve-Mile
cabin, to-night’s stop, and Forks cabin that you’ll
hit to-morrow night. And we’ll make our first set
right here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took one of the traps from Ned’s shoulder
and showed him how to make the set. The bait was
placed a few feet above the trap, in this case, on the
trunk of the tree, so that to reach it the marten
would almost certainly spring the trap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Put ’em fairly thick through here,” Doomsdorf
advised. “Lay more emphasis on fox and lynx in
the open barrens.” He stepped back from the set.
“Do you think you can find this place again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned looked it over with minute care, marking it
in relation to certain dead trees that lay across the
creek. “I think I can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the very essential of trapping, naturally.
It will come to be second nature after a while—without
marking it by trees or anything. You’ll
have better than a hundred traps; and it isn’t as
easy as it looks. Remember, I won’t be with you
the next time you pass this way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They tramped on, and Doomsdorf pointed out
where a wolverine had come down the glade and
crossed the creek. “You’ll curse at the very name
of wolverine before the season’s done,” Doomsdorf
told him, as Ned paused to study the imprint.
“He’s the demon of the snow so far as the trapper
is concerned. Nevertheless, you’ll want to take a
skin for your own use. It’s the one fur for the
hood of a parka—you can wear it over your mouth
in fifty below and it doesn’t get covered with ice
from your breath. But you’ll have to be a smarter
man than I think you are to catch him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few minutes later the timber became to be
more noticeably stunted, the trees farther and
farther apart, and soon they were in the open.
These were the barren lands, deep moss or rich
marsh grass already heavy with snow; and the only
trees remaining were a few willow, quivering aspen,
and birch along the bank of the creek. From time
to time the two men stopped to place their traps,
Doomsdorf explaining the various “sets”, how to
conceal the cold steel of which most all creatures
have such an instinctive fear, and how to eliminate
the human smell that might otherwise keep the
more cunning of the fur-bearers from the bait.
Once they paused before a great, cruel instrument
of iron, seemingly much too large to be a trap, that
had been left at the set from the previous trapping
season.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lift it,” Doomsdorf advised. Ned bent, finding
the iron itself heavy in his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No creature’s going to walk away with that on
his leg, is he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No? That’s all you know about it. I’ll admit
that you wouldn’t care to walk with it very far.
You would see why I didn’t take it into shelter at
the close of the season—although of course it’s
easy enough to haul on a sled. You notice it’s attached
to a chain, and that chain to a toggle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Toggle” was a word that Ned had never heard
before, but which plainly represented a great log,
or drag, to which the trap chain was attached. Ned
gazed, and another foolish question came to his lips.
“You use that because there isn’t a tree handy?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If there was a tree handy, I’d use it just the
same,” Doomsdorf explained. “There’s no holding
the animal I catch in that trap by chaining him
fast. No matter how big the tree or how stout the
chain, he’d break loose—or else he’d pull out his
foot. You’ve got to give him play. That’s why
we use a toggle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t mean he drags that great thing——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, only about halfway across the island before
I can possibly overtake him and shoot him,
bellowing like a devil every step of the way. Moreover,
the toggle has to be chained near the end,
rather than in the middle—otherwise he’ll catch
the ends back of a couple of tree trunks and break
loose. Now set the trap.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It took nearly all of Ned’s strength to push down
the powerful springs and set the great jaws. The
fact that he didn’t know just how to go about it
impeded him too. And when he stood erect again,
he found Doomsdorf watching him with keenest
interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t think you were man enough to do it,”
he commented. “You’ll say that’s quite a trap,
won’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s quite a trap,” Ned agreed shortly. “What
kind of an elephant do you take in it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No kind of an elephant, but one of the grandest
mammals that ever lived, at that. I don’t trap
them much, because I hardly get enough for their
skins to pay for handling them—you can guess
they’re immensely bulky. There’s a fair price for
their skulls, too, but the skull alone is a fair load for
a weak back. Last year I needed a few hides for
the cabin. Did you ever hear of the Kodiac bear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good Lord! One bear can’t move all that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Doomsdorf stood erect, and his eyes gleamed.
Evidently the great, savage monarch of the islands
of which he spoke was some way close to his own
savage heart. “He can move your heart into your
throat just to look at him!” he said. “One of the
grandest mammals that ever lived—the great,
brown bear of the islands. Of course, you ought
to know he’s by all odds the biggest bear on earth,
he and the polar bear just north of here—and the
biggest carnivorous animal on earth, for that matter.
Your lions, your tigers wouldn’t last a minute
under those great hooks of his. He’d tear your
whole chest out in one swipe. This seems to be
about the northern limit of his range—the big
brownies go all the way from Admiralty Islands,
in the south, clear up to here, with very little variation
as to size and color. There are not many on
the Skopins—but going around with just an axe
and a hunting knife for weapons, you’ll be glad
there aren’t any more. At this point their range
begins to coincide, to some slight degree, with the
polar bear—but of course just a stray gets down
below the Arctic circle. You’ve got to have a
whole caribou carcass to interest the old devil in the
way of bait. And now I’ll show you how to outfox
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He cut a slender whip, about half an inch in diameter,
from a near-by willow, and thrusting both
ends into the ground in front of the trap, made an
arch. “When the old boy comes along, he’ll lift
his front foot right over that arch, to avoid stepping
on anything that looks so unstable, and then
straight down into the trap,” Doomsdorf explained.
“If it was heavy wood, he’d rest his foot on it and
miss the trap.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few minutes later they came to what seemed to
Ned a new and interesting geological formation.
It seemed to be a noisy waterfall of three or four
feet, behind which the creek was dammed to the
proportions of a small, narrow lake. Yet the dam
itself didn’t appear to be a natural formation of
rock. It looked more like driftwood, but it was
inconceivable that mere drift could be piled in this
ordered way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Keenly interested, he bent to examine it.
Farther up the creek some heavy body struck the
water with a mighty splash. It was too swift, however,
for him to see what it was. There were no
power plants or mill wheels here, and thus it was
difficult to believe that human hands had gone to
the great labor of building such a dam. Only one
explanation remained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must be a beaver dam,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re right for once,” Doomsdorf agreed.
“Did you ever see better engineering? Even the
dam is built in an arch—the strongest formation
known to man—to withstand the waters. Sometime
I’ll tell you how they do it—there isn’t as
much premeditated cunning in it as you think. Do
you know what a beaver looks like?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Got big teeth——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Correct. It has to have ’em to cut all this
wood. Likely enough the little devils go considerable
distances up and down this creek to
get their materials. Sometimes they’ll dig great
canals for floating the sticks they use in their
dams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A big beaver weighs about fifty pounds—and
he’s about the handiest boy to trap there is. You’ll
wonder what the purpose of these dams is. As far
as I can make out, simply to keep the water at one
level. You know these little streams rise and fall
like the tides. They’ve learned, in a few hundred
thousand years of their development, that it doesn’t
pay to build a nice house and then have the creek
come up and wash it away and drown them out.
When they put down their winter food, they want
to be sure it’s going to be there when they want it—neither
washed away nor high and dry out of
water. The solution was—to build a dam. Now
I’ll show you how to catch a beaver.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed to Ned that the logical place to lay
the trap was on the beaver house itself—a great
pile of sticks and mud. But Doomsdorf explained
that a trap set on the house itself so alarmed the
animals that the entire colony was likely to desert
the dam. Instead, the trap was set just below the
surface of the water at a landing,—a place where
the beaver went in and out of the water in the
course of their daily work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No bait was used this time. The trap was covered
with fine mud with the idea that the beaver
would blunder into it either on leaving or entering
the water. A heavy sack of little stones from the
creek bed was attached to the chain, and a long
wire, leading from this, was fastened securely to a
tree on the creek bank. The arrangement was
really a merciful one to the beaver. The instant
the trap was sprung, the animal’s instinct was to
dive into deep water. Of course he dragged the
heavy sack with him and was unable to rise again.
The beaver, contrary to expectations, can not live
in water indefinitely. An air-breathing mammal,
he drowns almost as quickly as a human being
would under the same circumstances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They placed a second trap on the dam itself, then
encircling the meadow, continued on up the stream.
From time to time they made their sets, as this was
a favorable region for mink and otter, two of the
most beautiful and valuable furs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Time was passing swiftly for Ned. There was
even a quality of enjoyment in his reaction to the
day’s toil. Now as they mounted to the higher
levels, he was ever more impressed by the very magnitude
of the wilderness about—stretching for
miles in every direction to the shores of the sea.
The weary wastes got to him and stirred his imagination
as never before. He found, when he paused
to make the sets, that a certain measure of excitement
was upon him. Evidently there was a tang
and flavor in this snow-swept wilderness through
which he moved to make the blood flow swiftly in
the veins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Partly it lay in the constant happening of the unexpected.
Every few rods brought its little adventure:
perhaps a far-off glimpse of a fox; perhaps a
flock of hardy waterfowl, tardy in starting south,
flushing up with a thunderous beat of wings from
the water; perhaps the swift dive of that dreadful
little killer, the mink; possibly the track of a venerable
old bear, already drowsy and contemplating
hibernation, who had but recently passed that way.
But perhaps the greater impulse for excitement lay
in the expectation of what the next turn in the trail
might bring forth. There were only tracks here,
but the old bear himself might launch forth into a
deadly charge from the next thicket of birch trees.
The fox was only a fleet shadow far away, but any
moment they might run into him face to face, in
the act of devouring his prey. Ned found that his
senses had miraculously sharpened, that many little
nerves of which hitherto he had been unaware had
wakened into life and were tingling just under the
skin. Until fatigue came heavily upon him—only
the first hint of it had yet come to his thighs and
back—this particular part of his daily duties need
never oppress him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this dim, faltering hope was forgotten in the
travail of the next few hours. The load of heavy
traps on his back; the labor of tramping through
the snow; most of all the loss of bodily heat through
his flimsy, snow-wet clothes soon rewarded him for
daring to seek happiness on this desert of despair.
As the gray afternoon advanced, his quickened
spirit fell again: once more his senses were dulled,
and the crooked, boyish half-smile that had begun
to manifest itself faded quickly from his lips.
Doomsdorf still marched in his easy, swinging gait;
and ever it was a harder fight to keep pace. Yet
he dared not lag behind. His master’s temper was
ever uncertain in these long, tired hours of afternoon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tired out, weakened, aching in every muscle and
not far from the absolute limit of exhaustion, Ned
staggered to the cabin door at last. He had put
out all the traps he had brought from the home
cabin: thence his course lay along a blazed trail that
skirted the edge of the narrow timber belt, over the
ridge to the Forks cabin. Doomsdorf entered, then
in the half-light stood regarding the younger man
who had followed him in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned tried to stand erect. He must not yield yet
to the almost irresistible impulse to throw himself
down on the floor and rest. He dared not risk
Doomsdorf’s anger; how did he know what instruments
of torture the latter’s satanic ingenuity might
contrive in this lonely cabin! Nor was his mood to
be trusted to-night. His gray eyes shone with suppressed
excitement; and likely enough he would be
glad of an excuse for some diversion to pass the
hours pleasantly. It was very lonely and strange
out here, in the open, in the full sweep of the wind
over the barren lands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Ned wasn’t aware of Doomsdorf’s plans.
The great blond man stretched his arms, yawning,
buttoned his coat tighter about him, and turned to
go. “I’ll see you in about five days,” he remarked
laconically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned wakened abruptly from his revery. “You
mean—you aren’t going to show me anything
more?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s nothing more you can’t learn by yourself—by
hard experience. I’ve given you your
map and your directions for the trap line. A baby
couldn’t miss it. There’s traps on the wall—scatter
’em along between here and the Forks cabin.
There you will find another bunch to put between
there and Thirty-Mile cabin. So on clear around.
Over your head you see the stretchers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned looked up, and over the rafters, among other
supplies, were laid a large number of small boards,
planed smooth and of different sizes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve shown you how to set your traps, for every
kind of an animal,” Doomsdorf went on. “You
ought to be able to do the rest. By the time you
come around, we’ll likely have freezing weather—that
means you’ll have to thaw out your animals before
you skin them. If it’s a big animal, dead in
the trap, too heavy to carry into camp, you’ll have
to make a fire in the snow and thaw him out there.
Otherwise bring ’em in. You saw me skin that
otter I shot—skin all the smaller animals the same
way. Simply split ’em under the legs and peel ’em
out toward the head, as you would a banana. Of
course you’ll spoil plenty of skins at first, so far as
market value is concerned, but they’ll be all right
for your own use. The closer you can skin them,
the less fat you leave on the pelts, the less you’ll
have to flesh them when you get to your cabin.
When you can’t strip off any more fat, turn ’em
wrong side out on one of those boards—stretching
them tight. Use the biggest board you can put
in. Then hang ’em up in the cabin to dry. A skin
like a beaver, that you slit up the belly and which
comes off almost round, nail on the wall. All the
little tricks of the trade will come in time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here and here and here”—he paused, to
put in Ned’s hands a clasp hunting knife, razor
sharp, a small pocket hone to whet his tools, and a
light axe that had been hanging back of the stove—“are
some things you’ll need. The time will come
when you’ll need snowshoes, too. I ought to make
you make them yourself, but you’d never get it
done and I’d never get any furs. There’s a pair on
the rafters. Now I’m going to tramp back to the
cabin to spend the night—in more agreeable company.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment the two men stood regarding each
other in absolute silence. Then Doomsdorf’s keen
ears, eager for such sounds, caught the whisper of
Ned’s troubled breathing. Presently a leering
smile flashed through the blond beard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was as he thought. Ned’s mind was no longer
on furs. His face had been drawn and dark with
fatigue, but now a darker cloud spread across it,
like a storm through open skies, as some blood-curdling
thought made ghastly progress through
his brain. At first it was only startled amazement,
then swift disbelief—the manifestation of that
strange quirk in human consciousness that ever
tries to shield the spirit from the truth—and
finally terror, stark and without end. It showed in
the tragic loosening of every facial muscle; in the
cold drops that came out at the edge of the brown,
waving hair; in the slow, fixed light in his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was what Doomsdorf loved. He had seen
the same look in the faces of prisoners—newly
come to a stockade amid the snow and still hopeful
that the worst they had heard had been overdrawn—on
seeing certain implements of initiation; and
it had been a source of considerable amusement to
him. This was the thing that his diseased soul
craved. As the young man reached imploring
hands to his own great forearms, he hurled him
away with a ringing laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean—you and Lenore will be
alone——” Ned asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You saw the squaw start out with Bess?” was
the triumphant answer. “But why should you care?
It was Lenore’s own wish to stay. She’d take me
and comfort any time, sooner than endure the cold
with you. Of such stuff, my boy, are women
made.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hands reached out again, clasping tight upon
Doomsdorf’s forearms. Ned’s face, lifeless and
white as a stone, was no longer loose with terror.
A desperate fury had brought him to the verge of
madness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a foul lie!” he shouted, reckless of
Doomsdorf’s retaliation. “She didn’t dream that
you would do that——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Doomsdorf struck him off, hurling him against
the wall; but it was not with the idea of inflicting
punishment. Amused at his impotent rage, his
blow was not the driving shoulder blow which, before
now, had broken a human jaw to fragments.
Nor did he carry through, hammering his victim
into insensibility at his leisure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That gets you a little, doesn’t it?” he taunted.
Ned straightened, staring at him as if he were a
ghost. “Your sweetheart—that you’d sworn was
yours to the last ditch! I don’t mean that she’d
give herself willingly to me—yet. She’s just the
kind of girl I’d expect a weakling like yourself to
pick out—the type that would sooner go wrong
than endure hardship. And that’s why she’s more
or less safe, for the time being at least, from me.
Even if Sindy wasn’t coming back home to-night—probably
already there—you wouldn’t have to
fear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned could not speak, but Doomsdorf looked at
him with the fire of a zealot in his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want anything that’s that easy,” he said
with infinite contempt. “Sometimes the game is
harder. I take back something I inferred a moment
ago—that <span class='it'>all</span> women would do the same.
The best of them, the most of them, still will go
through hell for an idea; and that’s the kind whose
spirit is worth while to break. Do you know any
one who right now, likely enough, is trudging along
through this hellish snow with forty pounds of traps
over her back?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned shuddered, hurling off his doubt, believing
yet in the fidelity of his star. “I don’t know, and
I don’t care,” he answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what Bess Gilbert is doing, and you
know it. There, young man, is a woman worthy of
my steel!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned and strode out the door. Ned was
left to his thoughts and the still, small voices of the
waste places, alone with the wilderness night whose
word was the master word of life, and with the wind
that sobbed unhappy secrets as it swept his cabin
roof. He couldn’t help but listen, there in the twilight.
Thus the work of training Ned Cornet’s
soul went on, strengthening him to stand erect
when that stern officer, the Truth, looked into his
eyes; teaching him the mastery of that bright sword
of fortitude and steadfastness whereby he could
parry the most pitiless blows of fate.</p>

<div><h1>XXI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Thus</span> began a week of trial for Ned. For the
first time in his life he was thrown wholly upon his
own resources, standing or falling by his own
worth. Should he fall insensible in the snow there
were none to seek him and bring him into shelter.
If he should go astray and miss the cabins there
was no one to set him on the right path again. He
was meeting the wilderness alone, and face to face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cooking his meals, cutting the fuel and building
the fires that kept him warm, meeting the storm in
its fury and fighting a lone fight from the gray of
dawn to the day’s gray close, Ned made the long
circuit of his trap line. The qualities that carried
him far in his home city—such things as wealth
and position and culture—were as dust here. His
reliance now was the axe on his shoulder and the
hunting knife at his hip; but most of all his own
stamina, his own steadfastness, the cunning of his
brain and the strength of his sinews. And every
day found him stronger and better able to meet the
next.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Certain muscles most used in tugging through
the snow, seemingly worn to shreds the first day’s
march, strengthened under the stress, and he found
he did his daily stint with ever greater ease. Ever
he handled the little, daily crises with greater skill,
and this with less loss of vital energy: the crossing
of a swollen stream or a perilous morass; or the
climbing of a slippery glacier. Every day the wilderness
unrolled its pages to his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little daily encounters with the wild life were
ever a greater delight. He found pleasure in trying
to guess the identity of the lesser, scurrying
people he met on the trail: he found a moving
beauty in the far-off glimpse of the running pack,
in a vivid silhouette on the ridge at twilight; the
sight of a bull caribou tossing his far-spreading
antlers sent his blood moving fast in his veins. By
the grace of the Red Gods he was afforded the excitement
of being obliged to backtrack two hundred
yards in order gracefully to yield the trail to a
great, surly Alaskan bear already seeking a lair for
his winter sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He crossed the divide to Forks cabin, followed
the springs to Thirty-Mile cabin, descended to the
sea, and along the shore to the home cabin, just as
he had been told to do. He put out his traps as he
went in what seemed to him the most likely places,
using every wile Doomsdorf had taught him to increase
his chances for a catch. In spite of the fact
that he went alone, the second day was ever so much
easier than the first; and he came into the home
cabin only painfully tired, but not absolutely exhausted,
on the fifth. Of course he didn’t forget
that, other things being equal, these first five days
were his easiest days. Actual trapping had not yet
started: he had not been obliged to stop, thaw out
and skin such larger animals as would be found
dead in his traps; nor yet work late into the night
fleshing and stretching the pelts. A greater factor
was the moderate weather: light snowfall and temperature
above freezing, a considerable variance
from the deadly blizzards that would ensue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All through the five days he had strengthened
himself with the thought that Lenore awaited him
at the journey’s end; and she had never seemed so
lovely to him as when, returning in the gray twilight,
he saw her standing framed in the lighted
doorway of the home cabin. She had suffered no
ill-treatment in his absence. The great fear that
had been upon his heart was groundless, after all:
her face was fresh, her eyes bright, she was not lost
in despair. In spite of his aching muscles, his face
lighted with hopefulness and relief that was almost
happiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Doubtless it was his own eagerness that made her
seem so slow in coming into his arms; and his own
great fire that caused her to seem to lack warmth.
He had been boyishly anticipatory, foolishly exultant.
Yet it was all sweet enough. The girl fluttered
a single instant in his arms, and he felt repaid
for everything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me go,” she whispered tensely, when his
arms tried to hold her. “Don’t let Doomsdorf see.
He might kill you——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it came about that she didn’t finish the warning.
Presently she felt his arms turn to steel. She
felt herself thrust back until her eyes looked
straight into his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had never seen Ned in this mood before. Indeed
she couldn’t ever remember experiencing the
sensation that swept her now: secretly appalled at
him, burnt with his fire, wavering beneath his will.
She didn’t know he had arms like that. His face,
when she tried to meet it, hardly seemed his own.
The flesh was like gray iron, the eyes cold as stones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What has Doomsdorf to do with it?” he demanded.
“Has he any claim on you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not,” she hastened to reply. “He’s
treated me as well as could be expected. But you
know—he makes claims on us all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fact could not be denied. Ned turned from
her, nestling to the fire for warmth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The happiness he had expected in this long-awaited
night had failed to materialize. He ate
his great meal, sat awhile in sporadic conversation
with the girl in the snug cabin; then went
wearily to his blankets. He hardly knew what was
missing. Her beauty was no less; it was enhanced,
if anything, by the flush of the wind on her cheeks.
Yet she didn’t understand what he had been doing,
what he had been through. He held her interest
but slightly as he told of his adventures on the trail.
When in turn she talked to him, it was of her own
wrongs; and the old quick, eager sympathy somehow
failed to reach his heart. But it was all he
could expect on this terrible island. He must
thank what gods there were for the one kiss she had
given him—and be content. All happiness was
clouded here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Often, in the little hour after supper about the
stove, he wakened from his revery to find that he
had been thinking about Bess. She had come in
from her line the previous day and had gone out
again; and he had not dreamed that her absence
could leave such a gap in their little circle. He had
hardly regarded her at all, yet he found himself
missing her. She was always so high-spirited, encouraging
him with her own high heart. Of course
the very fact that they were just three, exiled
among foes, would make her absence keenly felt.
The mere bond of common humanity would do that.
Yet he found himself wishing that he had shown
greater appreciation of her kindness, her courage,
her sweet solicitude for him. On her lonely trap
line out in the wastes it was as if she had gone forever.
He found himself resenting the fact that
Lenore had but cold assent to his praise of her,
wholly unappreciative of the fact that her own ease
was due largely to Bess’s offer to do additional
work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But his blankets gave him slumber, and he rose
in the early hours, breakfasted, and started out on
his lonely trap line. He was not a little excited as
to the results of this morning’s tramp. Every skin
he took was his, to protect his own body from the
bitter, impending cold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first few traps had not been sprung. Out-witting
the wild creatures was seemingly not the
easy thing he had anticipated. The bait had been
stolen from a marten trap at the edge of the barrens,
but the jaws had failed to go home, and a subsequent
light snowfall had concealed the tracks by
which he might have identified the thief. Was
this the answer to his high hopes? But he had
cause to halt when he neared the trap on the beaver
dam.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment he couldn’t locate the trap. Then
he saw that the wire, fastened securely to the bank,
had become mysteriously taut. Not daring to hope
he began to tug it in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the end of the wire he found his trap, and in
the trap was a large beaver, drowned and in prime
condition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moment was really a significant one for Ned.
The little traps of steel, placed here and there
through the wilderness, had seemed a doubtful
project at best; but now they had shown results.
The incident gave him added confidence in himself
and his ability to battle successfully these perilous
wilds. The rich, warm skin would help to clothe
him, and he would easily catch others to complete
his wardrobe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The beaver was of course not frozen; and the
skin stripped off easily under the little, sawing
strokes of his skinning knife. He was rather surprised
at its size. It came off nearly round, and it
would stretch fully thirty-two inches in diameter.
Washing it carefully, he put it over his back and
started on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Other traps yielded pelts in his long day’s march.
The trap on the beaver landing contained a muskrat;
he found several more of the same furred rodents
in his traps along the creek; and small skins
though they were, he had a place for every one.
Once an otter, caught securely by the hind leg,
showed fight and had to be dispatched by a blow on
the head with a club; and once he was startled when
a mink, scarcely larger than his hand, leaped from
the snowy weeds, trap and all, straight for his
ankle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no more ferocious creature in all the
mammalian world than this. “Little Death,” was
a name for him in an aboriginal tongue; and it was
perfectly in accord with his disposition. His eyes
were scarlet; he opened his rapacious jaws so wide
that they resembled those of a deadly serpent; he
screamed again and again in the most appalling
fury. This was the demon of the Little People: the
snaky Stealth that murdered the nestlings in the
dead of night; the cruel and remorseless hunter
whose red eyes froze the snowshoe hare with terror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tired out, barely able to stand erect, yet wholly
content with his day’s catch, Ned made the cabin in
the twilight, built his fire, and cooked his meager
supper. After supper he skinned out such little
animals as he had not taken time to skin on the
trail, fleshed and stretched his pelts, then hung
them up to dry. He was almost too tired to remove
his wet garments when the work was done.
He hardly remembered drawing the blankets over
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus ended the first of a long series of arduous
days. The hardship was incomparably greater
than that endured by the great run of those hardy
men, the northern trappers, not only because of his
inadequate clothes, but because the line had been
laid out by a giant’s rule. Doomsdorf had spaced
his cabins according to his own idea of a full day’s
work, and that meant they were nearly twice as far
apart as those of the average trap line. Bess had
been given the line he had laid out for his squaw,
hardly half so rigorous, yet all the average man
would care to attempt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in spite of the hardship, the wrack of cold,
the fatigue that crept upon him like a dreadful
sickness, Ned had many moments of comparative
pleasure. One of these moments, seemingly yielding
him much more delight than the occasion warranted,
occurred at the end of the second day of
actual trapping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This day’s march had taken him to the Forks
cabin; and there, as twilight drew about him, he was
amazed to hear the nearing sound of footsteps in
the snow. Some one was coming laboriously toward
him, with the slow, dragging tread of deep
fatigue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thing made no sense at all. Human companionship,
in these gray and melancholy wastes,
was beyond the scope of the imagination. For a
moment he stared in dumb bewilderment like a man
at the first seizure of madness. Then he sprang
through the door and out on the snowy slope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not just a whim of the fancy. A dim
form moved toward him out of the grayness, hastening,
now that his lantern light gleamed on the
snow. Presently Ned saw the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Bess, of course. At this point their lines
coincided. It was her third stop, and since she had
left the home cabin a day ahead of him, she was perfectly
on schedule. He could hardly explain the
delight that flashed through him at the sight of her.
In this loneliness and silence mere human companionship
was blessing enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His appearance in the doorway was not a surprise
to Bess. She had counted the days carefully,
and she knew his schedule would bring him here.
But now she was too near dead with fatigue to give
him more than a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The night that ensued was one of revelation to
Ned. His first cause of wonder was the well of
reserve strength that suddenly manifested itself in
the hour of need. He had not dreamed but that he
was at the edge of collapse from the long day’s
toil; his brain had been dull with fatigue, and he
was almost too tired to build his fire, yet he found
himself a tower of strength in caring for the exhausted
girl. It was as if his own fatigue had mysteriously
vanished when he became aware of hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With scarcely a word he lifted her to the cot,
covered her with a blanket, and in spite of her protests,
went speedily about the work of cooking her
supper. It was a strange thing what pleasure it
gave him to see the warm glow of the life stream
flow back into her blanched cheeks, and her deep,
blue eyes fill again with light. Heretofore this
twilight hour, at the end of a bitter day, had been
the worst hour of all; but to-night it was the best.
He hadn’t dreamed that so much pleasure could be
gained simply by serving others. In addition to
some of the simple staples that he found among the
cabin’s supplies, he served her, as a great surprise,
the plump, white breast of a ptarmigan that he had
found in one of his ermine traps; and it was somehow
a deep delight to see her little, white teeth
stripping the flesh from the bone. He warmed her
up with hot coffee; then sat beside her while the
night deepened at the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had a quiet hour of talk before he drew the
blankets about her shoulders and left her to drift
away in sleep. He was unexplainably exultant;
light-hearted for all this drear waste that surrounded
him. This little hut of logs was home, to-night.
The cold could not come in; the wind would
clamor at the roof in vain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did her work for her to-night. He skinned
the smaller animals she had brought in, then fleshed
and stretched all the pelts she had taken. After
preparing his own skins, he made a hard bed for
himself on the floor of the hut.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was with real regret that they took different
ways in the dawn. Ned’s last office was to prepare
kindling for her use on her next visit to the cabin
four days hence—hardly realizing that he was
learning a little trick of the woodsman’s trade that
would stand him in good stead in many a dreadful
twilight to come. Only the veriest tenderfoot plans
on cutting his kindling when he finishes his day’s
toil. The tried woodsman, traveling wilderness
trails, does such work in the morning, before fatigue
lays hold of him. The thing goes farther:
even when he does not expect to pass that way
again he is careful to leave the kindling pile for the
next comer. Like all the traditions of the North,
it is founded on necessity: the few seconds thus
saved in striking the flame have more than once, at
the end of a bitter day, saved the flame of a sturdy
life. This is the hour when seconds count. The
hands are sometimes too cold to hold the knife: the
tired spirit despairs at this labor of cutting fuel. It
is very easy, then, to lie still and rest and let the cold
take its toll.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trails of these two trappers often crossed, in
the weeks to come. They kept close track of each
other’s schedules, and they soon worked out a system
whereby they could meet at the Forks cabin at
almost every circuit. They arranged it wholly
without embarrassment, each of them appreciating
the other’s need for companionship. By running a
few traps toward the interior from the forks, Bess
made an excuse to take five days to her route; and
for once Doomsdorf seemed to fail to see her real
motive. Perhaps he thought she was merely trying
to increase her catch, thus hoping to avoid the
penalties he had threatened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned found to his amazement that they had many
common interests. They were drawn together not
only by their toil, and by their mutual fear of
Doomsdorf’s lash; but they also shared a deep and
growing interest in the wilderness about them.
The wild life was an absorbing study in itself.
They taught each other little tricks of the trapper’s
trade, narrated the minor adventures of their daily
toil; they were of mutual service in a hundred different
ways. No longer did Ned go about his work
in the flimsy clothes of the city. Out of the pelts
he had dried she helped to make him garments and
moccasins as warm and serviceable as her own, supplied
through an unexpected burst of generosity on
Doomsdorf’s part soon after their arrival on the
island. They brought their hardest problems to
the Forks cabin and solved them together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the winter advanced upon them, they found
an increasing need of mutual help. The very problem
of living began to demand their best coöperation.
The winter was more rigorous than they had
ever dreamed in their most despairing moments, so
that coöperation was no longer a matter of pleasure,
but the stark issue of life itself. The spirit,
alone and friendless, yielded quickly in such times
as these.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It got to be a mystery with them after while, why
they hadn’t given up long since, instead of playing
this dreadful, nightmare game to its ultimate end of
horror and death. Why were they such fools as to
keep up the hopeless fight, day after day through
the intense cold, bending their backs to the killing
labor, when at any moment they might find rest and
peace? They did not have to look far. Freedom
was just at their feet. Just to fall, to lie still; and
the frost would creep swiftly enough into their
veins. Sleep would come soon, the delusion of
warmth, and then Doomsdorf’s lash could never
threaten them again. But they found no answer to
the question. It was as if a power beyond themselves
was holding them up. It was as if there was
a debt to pay before they could find rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Day after day the snow sifted down, ever laying
a deeper covering over the island, bending down
the limbs of the strong trees, obscuring all things
under this cold infinity of white. The traps had to
be laboriously dug out and reset, again and again.
These were the days when the old “sourdough”
on the mainland remained within his cabin, merely
venturing to the door after fuel; but Ned and Bess
knew no such mercy. Their fate was to struggle
on through those ever-deepening drifts until they
died. Driven by a cruel master they dared not rest
even a day. Walking was no longer possible without
snowshoes; and even these sank deep in the soft
drifts, the webs filling with snow, so that to walk a
mile was the most bitter, heart-breaking labor.
Yet their fate was to plow on, one day upon another,—strange,
dim figures in the gray, whirling
flakes—the full, bitter distances between their
cabins. To try to lay out meant death, certain and
very soon. Moreover they could not even move
with their old leisure. The days were constantly
shorter, just a ray of light between great curtains
of darkness; and only by mushing at the fastest
possible walking pace were they able to make it
through.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the skies cleared, an undreamed degree of
cold took possession of the land. Seemingly every
trickle of moving water was already frozen hard,
the sea sheltered by the island chain was an infinity
of ice, snow-swept as was the rest of the weary
landscape, but now the breath froze on the beard,
and the eyelids one upon another. The fingers
froze in the instant that the fur gloves were removed,
and the hottest fires could hardly warm the
cabins. And on these clear, bitter nights the
Northern Lights were an ineffable glory in the sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A strange atmosphere of unreality began to
cloud their familiar world. They found it increasingly
hard to believe in their own consciousnesses;
to convince themselves they were still struggling
onward instead of lying lifeless in the snow. It
was all dim like a dream,—snow and silence and
emptiness, and the Northern Lights lambent in the
sky. And for a time this was the only mercy that
remained. Their perceptions were blunted: they
were hardly aware of the messages of pain and torture
that the nerves brought to the brain. And
then, as ever, there came a certain measure of readjustment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their bodies built up to endure even such hardship
as this. The fact that the snow at last packed
was a factor too: they were able to skim over the
white crust at a pace even faster than the best time
they had made in early fall. They mastered the
trapper’s craft, learning how to skin a beaver with
the fewest number of strokes, and in such a manner
that the minimum amount of painstaking fleshing
was required; and how to bait and set the traps in
the fastest possible time. They learned their own
country, and thus the best, easiest, and quickest
routes from cabin to cabin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The result was that at last the companionship
between Bess and Ned, forgotten in the drear horror
of the early winter months, was revived. Again
they had pleasant hours about the stove at the
Forks cabin, sometimes working at pelts, sometimes
even enjoying the unheard-of luxury of a few
minutes of idleness. While before they had come
in almost too tired to be aware of each other’s
existence, now they were fresh enough to exchange
a few, simple friendly words—even, on rare occasions,
to enjoy a laugh together over some little disaster
of the trail. The time came when they knew
each other extremely well. In their hours of talk
they plumbed each other’s most secret views and
philosophies, and helped to solve each other’s spiritual
problems.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very naturally, and scarcely aware of the fact
themselves, they had come to be the best of companions.
As Ned once said, when a night of particular
beauty stirred his imagination and loosened
his stern lips, they had been “through hell” together;
and the finest, most enduring companionship
was only to have been expected. But it went
farther than a quiet sort of satisfaction in each
other’s presence. Each had got to know approximately
what the other would do in any given case;
and that meant that they afforded mutual security.
They had mutual trust and confidence, which was
no little satisfaction on this island of peril. Blunted
and dulled before, their whole consciousness now
seemed to sharpen and waken; they not only regarded
each other with greater confidence: their
whole outlook had undergone significant change.
During the first few months of early winter they
had moved over their terrible trails like mechanical
machines, doing all they had to do by instinct,
whether eating, sleeping, or working; self-consciousness
had been almost forgotten, self-identity
nearly lost. But now they were themselves again,
looking forward keenly to their little meetings,
their interests ever reaching farther, the first beginnings
of a new poise and self-confidence upon them.
They had stood the gaff! They had come through.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned’s hours with Lenore, however, gave him less
satisfaction than they had at first. She somehow
failed to understand what he had been through.
He had found out what real hardship meant, and
he couldn’t help but resent, considering her own
comparative comfort, her attitude of self-pity. Always
she wept for deliverance from the island,
never letting Ned forget that his own folly had
brought her hither; always expecting solicitude instead
of giving it; always willing to receive all the
help that Ned could give her, but never willing to
sacrifice one whit of her own comfort to ease his lot.
Because he had done man’s work, and stood up
under it, he found himself expecting more and more
from her,—and failing to receive it. Her lack of
sportsmanship was particularly distressing to him
at a time when sobbing and complaints could only
tear down his own hard-fought-for spirit to endure.
Most of all he resented her attitude toward Bess.
She had no sympathy for what the girl had been
through, even refusing to listen to Ned’s tales of
her. And she seemed to resent all of Ned’s kindnesses
to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly, by the school of hardship and conquest
over hardship, Ned Cornet was winning a new self-mastery,
a new self-confidence to take the place of
the self-conceit that had brought him to disaster.
But the first real moment of wakening was also one
of peril,—on the trapping trail one clear afternoon
toward the bitter close of January.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had been quietly following that portion of
his trap line that followed the timber belt between
the Twelve-Mile cabin and Forks cabin, and the
blazed trail had led him into the depths of a heavy
thicket of young spruce. He had never felt more
secure. The midwinter silence lay over the land;
the cold and fearful beauty of a snow-swept wilderness
had hold of his spirit; the specter of terror and
death that haunted these wintry wastes was nowhere
manifest to his sight. The only hint of danger
that the Red Gods afforded him did not half
penetrate his consciousness and did not in the least
call him from his pleasant fancies. It was only a
glimpse of green where the snow had been shaken
from a compact little group of sapling spruce just
beside one of his sets. Likely the wind had caught
the little trees just right; perhaps some unfortunate
little fur-bearer, a marten perhaps, or a fisher, had
sprung back and forth among the little trees in an
effort to free himself from the trap. He walked
up quietly, located the tree to which the trap chain
was attached, bent and started to draw the trap
from the small, dense thicket whence some creature
had dragged it. He was only casually interested
in what manner of poor, frozen creature would be
revealed between the steel jaws. The beauty of
the day had wholly taken his mind from his work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One moment, and the forest was asleep about
him; the little trees looked sadly burdened with
their loads of snow. The next, and the man was
hurled to the ground by a savage, snarling thing
that leaped from the covert like the snow demon it
was; and white, gleaming fangs were flashing toward
his throat.</p>

<div><h1>XXII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Except</span> for the impediment of the trap on the
creature’s foot, there would have been but one blow
to that battle in the snow. White fangs would
have gone home where they were aimed, and all of
Ned Cornet’s problems would have been simply
and promptly solved. There would have been a
few grotesque sounds, carrying out among the impassive
trees,—such sounds as a savage hound
utters over his bone, and perhaps, a strange motif
carrying through, a few weird whisperings, ever
growing fainter, from a torn throat that could no
longer convey the full tones of speech; and perhaps
certain further motion, perhaps a wild moment of
odd, frenzied leaping back and forth, fangs flashing
here and there over a form that still shivered as if
with bitter cold. But these things would not have
endured long: the sounds, like wakeful children,
speedily hiding and losing themselves in the great
curtains of silence and the wilderness itself swiftly
returning to its slumber. Drifting snow dust, under
the wind, would have soon paled and finally
obliterated the crimson stain among the little
trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned would have been removed from Doomsdorf’s
power in one swiftly passing instant, the wilderness
forgetting the sound of his snowshoes in its
silent places. All things would be, so far as mortal
eyes can discern, as if his soul had never found
lodging in his body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was not some little fur-bearer, helpless in
the trap. It was no less a creature than that great
terror of the snow, a full-grown Arctic wolf, almost
as white as the drifts he hunted through. Only the
spruce trees knew how this fierce and cunning
hunter came to snare his foot in the jaws of a marten
trap. Nor could any sensible explanation be
made why the great wolf did not break the chain
with one lunge of his powerful body, instead of
slinking into the coverts and waiting developments.
The ways of the wild creatures quite often fail of
any kind of an explanation; and it is a bold woodsman
who will say what any particular creature will
do under any particular condition. When he saw
Ned’s body within leaping range, he knew the desperate
impulse to fight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>None of the lower creatures are introspective in
regard to their impulses. They follow them without
regard to consequences. The wolf leaped with
incredible speed and ferocity. The human body is
not built to stand erect under such a blow: the
mighty, full-antlered caribou would have gone
down the same way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chain of the trap broke like a spring as he
leaped. The steel leash that is often used to restrain
a savage dog would have broken no less
quickly. There was no visible recoil: what little
resistance there was seemingly did not in the least
retard the blow. It did, however, affect its accuracy.
That fact alone saved Ned from instant
death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as the wolf lunged toward him to complete
his work—after the manner of some of the beasts
of prey when they fail to kill at the first leap—an
inner man of might seemed to waken in Ned’s
prone body. A great force came to life within him.
He lunged upward and met the wolf in the teeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Months before, when a falling tree had lashed
down at him, he had seen a hint of this same, innate
power. It was nothing peculiar to him: most men,
sooner or later, see it manifested in some hour of
crisis. But since that long-ago day it had been immeasurably
enhanced and increased. While his
outer, physical body had been developing, it had
been strengthening too. Otherwise it would have
been of little avail against that slashing, leaping,
frenzied demon of the snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This inner power hurled him into a position of
defense; but it would have saved him only an instant
if it had not been for its staunch allies of
muscles of tempered steel. For months they had
been in training for just such a test as this; but
Ned himself had never realized anything of their
true power. He hadn’t known that his nerves were
as finely keyed as a delicate electrical instrument,
so that they might convey the commands of his
brain with precision and dispatch. He suddenly
wakened to find himself a marvelous fighting machine,
with certain powers of resistance against
even such a foe as this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A great surge of strength, seemingly without
physical limitation, poured through him. In one
great bound he overcame the deadly handicap of
his own prone position, springing up with terrible,
reaching, snatching hands and clasping arms.
Some way, he did not know how, he hurled that
hundred pounds of living steel from his body before
the white fangs could go home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there was not an instant’s pause. Desperate
with fury, the wolf sprang in again,—a long,
white streak almost too fast for the eye to follow.
But he did not find Ned at a disadvantage now.
The man had wrenched to one side to hurl the creature
away, but he had already caught his balance
and had braced to meet the second onslaught. A
white-hot fury had descended upon him, too—obliterating
all sense of terror, yielding him wholly to
such fighting instincts as might be innate within
him. Nor did they betray him, these inner voices.
They directed the frightful power of his muscles in
the one way that served him best.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned did not wait to catch the full force of that
blow. His powerful thighs, made iron hard in
these last bitter weeks, drove him out and up in an
offensive assault. His long body seemed to meet
that of the wolf full in the air. Then they rolled
together into the drifts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned landed full on top of the body of the wolf;
and with a mighty surge of his whole frame he tried
to strengthen his own advantageous position. His
mighty knee clasped at the animal’s breast, pressing
with all his strength with the deadly intention of
crushing the ribs upon the wild heart. And he
gave no heed to the clawing feet. His instincts
told him surely that in the white fangs alone lay his
danger. With one arm he encircled the shaggy
neck; with the other he tried to turn the great
muzzle from his flesh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wolf wriggled free, sending home one vicious
bite into the flesh just under the arm; and for a
breath both contestants seemed to be playing some
weird, pinwheel game in the snow. The silence of
the everlasting wild was torn to shreds by the noise
of battle,—the frantic snarling of the wolf, the
wild shouts of this madman who had just found his
strength. No moment of Ned’s life had ever been
fraught with such passion; none had ever been of
such lightning vividness. He fought as he had
never dreamed he could fight; and the glory of
battle was upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It might be that Doomsdorf could have picked
up the great white creature by the scruff of the neck
and beat his brains out against a tree. Yet Ned
knew, in some cool, back part of his mind, that this
was a foe worthy of the best steel of any man, however
powerful. Even men of unusually great
strength would have been helpless in an instant before
those slashing fangs. Yet never for an instant
did he lose hope. Bracing himself, he clamped
down again with mighty knees on the wolf’s breast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again the slashing fangs caught him, but he was
wholly unaware of the pain. The muscles of his
arms snapped tight against the skin, the great tendons
drew, and he jerked the mighty head around
and back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then for a moment both contestants seemed to
lie motionless in the snow. The wolf lay like a
great hound before the fireside,—fore legs
stretched in front, body at full length. Ned
lay at one side, the animal’s body between his knees,
one arm around his neck, the other thrusting back
the great head. The whole issue of life or death,
victory or defeat, was suddenly immensely simplified.
It depended solely on whether or not Ned
had the physical might to push back the shaggy
head and shatter the vertebræ.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no sense of motion. Rather they were
like figures in metal, a great artist’s theme of incredible
stress. Ned’s face was drawn and black
from congested blood. His lips were drawn back,
the tendons of his hand, free of the glove, seemed
about to break through the skin. For that long
moment Ned called on every ounce of strength of
his body and soul. Only his body’s purely physical
might could force back the fierce head the ghastly
inch that was needed; only the high-born spirit of
strength, the mighty urge by which man holds dominion
over earth and sea, could give him resolution
to stand the incredible strain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Time stood still. A thousand half-crazed fancies
flew through his mind. His life blood seemed to be
starting from his pores, and his heart was tearing
itself to shreds in his breast. But the wolf was
quivering now. Its eyes were full of strange, unworldly
fire. And then Ned gave a last, terrific
wrench.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A bone broke with a distinct crack in the utter
silence. And as he fell forward, spent, the great
white form slacked down and went limp in his
arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like a man who had been asleep Ned regained
his feet. The familiar world of snow and forest
rushed back to him, deep in the enchantment of the
winter silence; and it was as if the battle had never
occurred. Such warlike sounds as had been uttered
were smothered in the stillness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet the sleeve of his fur coat was torn, and dark
red drops were dripping from his fingers. They
made crimson spots in the immaculate snow. And
just at his feet a white wolf lay impotent, never
again to strike terror into his heart by its wild, unearthly
chant on the ridge. The two had met, here
in the wolf’s own snows; and now one lay dead at
his conqueror’s feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whose was the strength that had laid him low!
Whose mighty muscles had broken that powerful
neck! Vivid consciousness swept back to Ned; and
with it a deep and growing exultation that thrilled
the inmost chords of his being. It was an ancient
madness, the heritage of savage days when man
and beast fought for dominance in the open places;
but it had not weakened and dimmed in the centuries.
His eye kindled, and he stood shivering
with excitement over his dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had conquered. He had fought his way to
victory. And was there any reason in heaven or
earth why he should not fight on to freedom—out
of Doomsdorf’s power? The moving spirit of
inspiration seemed to bear him aloft.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Drunk with his own triumph, Ned could not immediately
focus his attention on any definite train
of thought. At first he merely gave himself up to
dreams, a luxury that since the first day on the
island he had never permitted himself. For many
moments after the exultation of his victory had begun
to pass away, he was still so entranced by
dreams of freedom that he could not consider ways
and means.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The word freedom had come to have a tangible
meaning for him in these last dreadful months; its
very idea was dear beyond any power of his to tell.
It was so beloved a thing that at first his cold logic
could not take hold of it: its very thought brought
a luster as of tears to his eyes and a warm glow,
as in the first drifting of sleep, to his brain. He
had found out what freedom meant and how unspeakably
beautiful it was. In his native city, however,
he had taken it as a matter of course. Because
it was everywhere around him he was no more
conscious of it than the air he breathed; and he felt
secret scorn of much of the sentimental eloquence
concerning it. It had failed to get home to him,
and many of his generation had forgotten it, just
as they had forgotten the Author of their lives. It
was merely something that feeble old men, amusing
in their earnestness and their badges of the
Grand Army so proudly worn on their tattered
clothes, spoke of with a curious, deep solemnity,
which a scattered few of his friends, from certain
hard-fighting divisions, had learned on battlefields
in France; but which was of little importance in his
own life. When he did think of it at all he was
very likely to confuse it with license. Now and
then, when heady liquor had hold of him, he had
amused his friends with quite a lecture concerning
freedom,—particularly in its relation to the Volstead
act. But the old urge and devotion that was
the life theme of hundreds of generations that had
preceded him had seemed cold in his spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had learned the truth up here. He had
found out it was the outer gate to all happiness;
and everything else worth while was wholly dependent
upon it. As he stood in this little snowy
copse beside the dead wolf, even clearer vision came
to him concerning it. Was it not the dream of the
ages? Was not all struggle upward toward this
one star,—not only economic and religious freedom,
but freedom from the tyranny of the elements,
from the scourge of disease, from the soiling hand
of ignorance and want? And what quality made
for dominance as much as love of freedom?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a familiar truth that no race was great
without this love. Suddenly he saw that this was
the first quality of greatness, whether in nations or
individuals. The degree of this love was the degree
of worth itself; and only the fawning weakling,
the soul lost to honor and self-respect, was
content to live beneath a master’s lash when there
was a fighting chance for liberty!</p>

<p class='pindent'>A fighting chance! The phrase meant nothing
less than the chance of death. But all through the
loner roll of the centuries the bravest men had defied
this chance; and they would not lift their helmets
to those that eschewed it. But now he knew
the truth of that stern old law of tribes and nations,—a
law sometimes forgotten yet graven on the
everlasting stone—that he who will not risk his
life for liberty does not deserve to live it. The
thing held good with him now. <span class='it'>It held good with
Bess and Lenore as well.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>That was the test!</span> It was the last, cruel trial in
the Training Camp of Life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Deeply moved and exalted, he lifted his face to
the cold, blue skies as if for strength. For the instant
he stood almost motionless, oblivious to his
wounds and his torn clothes, a figure of unmistakable
dignity in those desolate drifts. He knew what
he must do. He too must stand trial, bravely and
without flinching. For Ned Cornet had come into
his manhood.</p>

<div><h1>XXIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>In</span> a little while Ned stripped the pelt from the
warm body of the wolf and continued down his line
of traps. He was able to think more coherently
now and consider methods and details. And by the
same token of clear thought, he was brought face
to face with the fact of the almost insuperable obstacles
in his path.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For all he could see now, Doomsdorf had surrounded
them with a stone wall. He had seemingly
thought of everything, prepared for every
contingency, and left them not the slightest gateway
to hope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Plans for freedom first of all seemingly had to
include Doomsdorf’s death. That was the first essential,
and the last. Could they succeed in striking
the life from their master, they could wait in
the cabin until the trader <span class='it'>Intrepid</span> should touch
their island in the spring. It can be said for Ned
that he conjectured upon the plan without the
slightest whisper of remorse, the least degree of
false sentiment. The fact that their master was,
more or less, a human being did not change the
course of his thought whatever. He would hurl
that wicked soul out of the world with never an
instant’s pity, and his only prayer would be that it
might fall into the real hell that he had tried to
imitate on earth. There could be no question about
that. If, through some mercy, the brute lay helpless
for a single second at his feet, it would be time
enough for the deed Ned had in mind. His arm
would never falter, his cruel axe would shatter
down as pitilessly as upon some savage beast of the
forest. He had not forgotten what the three of
them had endured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The difficulty lay in finding an opening of attack.
Doomsdorf’s rifle was never loaded except
when it was in his arms, and he wore his pistol in
his belt, day and night. For all his hopelessness,
Ned had noticed, half inadvertently, that he always
took precautions against a night attack. The
squaw slept on the outside of their cot and would
be as difficult to pass without arousing as a sleeping
dog. The cabin itself was bolted, not to be
entered without waking both occupants; and the
three prisoners of course slept in the newer cabin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bess had told him of Doomsdorf’s encounter
with Knutsen, describing with particular emphasis
the speed with which the murderer had whipped
out his pistol. He could get it into action long before
Ned could lay bare his clasp knife. Indeed,
mighty man that he was, he could crush Ned to
earth with one bound at the latter’s first offensive
movement. And Doomsdorf was always particularly
watchful when Ned carried his axe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet the fact remained that in his axe alone lay
the only possible hope of success. Some time Ned
might see an opportunity to swing it down: perhaps
he could think of some wile to put Doomsdorf
at a disadvantage. It was inconceivable that
they should try to escape without first rendering
Doomsdorf helpless to follow them. They could
attempt neither to conceal themselves on the island,
or cross the ice straight to Tzar Island without the
absolute certainty of being hunted down and punished.
What form that punishment would take
Ned dared not guess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was true that Doomsdorf kept but a perfunctory
watch over Ned and Bess while they plied
their trap lines. But long ago he had explained
to them the hopelessness of attempting to load their
backs with food and strike off across the ice on the
slim chance of encountering some inhabited island.
The plan, he had said, had not been worth a
thought, and even now, in spite of his new courage,
Ned found that it promised little. In the first
place, to venture out into that infinity of ice, where
there was not a stick of fuel and the polar wind was
an icy demon day and night, meant simply to die
without great question or any considerable delay.
The islands were many, but the gray ice between
them insuperably broad and rough. As Doomsdorf
had said, they could not get much of a start;
scarcely a day went by but that Doomsdorf, from
some point of vantage where his daily hunting excursions
carried him, discerned the distant forms
of one or both of his two trappers across the snowy
barrens; and he would be quick to investigate if
they were missing. His powerful legs and mighty
strength would enable him to overtake the runaways
in the course of a few hours. But lastly,
settling the matter once and for all, there was the
subject of Lenore. He could neither smuggle her
out nor leave her to Doomsdorf’s vengeance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The plan might be worth considering, except for
her. Of course, the odds would be tragically long
on the side of failure; but all he dared pray for
was a fighting chance. As matters lay, it was
wholly out of the question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seemingly the only course was to lie low, always
to be on the watch for the moment of opportunity.
Some time, perhaps, their master’s vigilance would
relax. Just one little instant of carelessness on his
part might show the way. Perhaps the chance
would come when the <span class='it'>Intrepid</span> put into the island
to buy the season’s furs, if indeed life dwelt in his
own body until that time. Ned didn’t forget that
long, weary months of winter still lay between.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He concluded that he would not take Lenore
into his confidence at once. That would come later,—when
he had something definite to propose.
Lately she had not shown great confidence in him,
scorning his ability to shelter her and serve her; and
of course she would have only contempt for any
such vague hope as this. He had nothing to offer
now but the assurance of his own growing sense of
power. As yet his hope lay wholly in the realization
of the late growth and development of his own
character. So far as material facts went, the barriers
between her and her liberty were as insuperable as
ever. He would not be able to encourage her: more
likely, by her contempt, she would jeopardize his
own belief in himself. Besides, for all his great
love for her, he could not make himself believe that
she was of fighting metal. He found, in this moment
of analysis of her soul, that he could not look
to her for aid. She was his morning star, all that
he could ask in woman, and he had chosen her for
her worth and beauty, rather than for a helpmate,
a fortress at his side. Yes, coöperation with
her might injure, rather than increase, his chances
for success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He dismissed in an instant the idea of telling
Bess. His loyalty to Lenore demanded that, at
least. She must not go where his own betrothed was
excluded. If the thought came that Bess, by light
of courage and fortitude, had already gone where
in weakness and self-pity Lenore could not possibly
follow—the windy snow fields and the bitter
crests of the rugged hills—he pushed it sternly
from him. The whole thing was a matter of instinct
with him, perhaps a wish to shield himself
from invidious comparisons of the two girls. He
would have liked to convince himself that Lenore
could be his ally, but he was wholly unable to do
so. Realizing that, he preferred to believe that
Bess was likewise incompetent. But he knew he
must not let his mind dwell to any great length
upon the subject. He might be forced to change
his mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He must make a lone fight. He must follow a
lone trail—like the old gray pack leader whose
sluts cannot keep pace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thereafter, day and night, Ned watched his
chances. Never he climbed to the top of the ridge
but that he searched, with straining eyes, for the
glimpse of a dog-sledge on the horizon, or perhaps
the faint line of a distant island. On the nights
that he spent at the home cabin, he made an intense
study of Doomsdorf’s most minor habits, trying to
uncover some little failing, some trifling carelessness
that might give him his opportunity. He
made it a point to leave his axe in easy reaching
distance; his clasp knife, in a holster of fur, was
always open in his pocket, always ready to his hand.
All day, down the weary length of his trap line, he
considered ways and means.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Simply because the wild continued to train him,
he was ever stronger for this great, ultimate trial.
Not only his intent was stronger, his courage
greater, but his body also continued its marvelous
development. His muscles were like those of a
grizzly: great bunches of tendons, hard as stone,
moving under his white skin. Every motion was
lithe and strong; his energy was a never-failing
fountain; his eyes were vivid and clear against the
old-leather hue of his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no longer an unpleasant discoloration
in the whites of his eyes. They were a cold, hard,
pale blue; and the little network of lines that had
once shown faintly at his cheek bones had completely
faded. His hands had killing strength; his neck
was a brown pillar of muscle. Health was upon
him, in its full glory, to the full meaning of the
word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found, to his great amazement, that his mental
powers had similarly developed. His thought
was more clear, and it flowed in deeper channels.
It was no effort for him now to follow one line of
thought to its conclusion. The tendency to veer
off in the direction of least resistance had been entirely
overcome. He could be of some aid, now,
in the fur house of Godfrey Cornet. He felt he
would like to match wits with his father’s competitors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He would need not only this great physical
strength, but also his enhanced mental powers in
the trial and stress that were to come. Doomsdorf’s
tyranny could not be endured forever; they were
being borne along toward a crisis as if on an ocean
current. And for all his growth, Ned never made
the fatal mistake of considering himself a physical
match for Doomsdorf. Over and above the fact
that the latter was armed with rifle and pistol, Ned
was still a child in his hands. It was simply a case
of intrinsic limitations. It was as if the wolf, chain-lightning
savagery that he is, should try to lay low
the venerable grizzly bear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sooner or later the crisis would fall upon them,—a
fit of savage anger on Doomsdorf’s part, or a
wrong that could not be endured, even if death were
the penalty for rebellion. Moreover, Ned could not
escape the haunting fear that such a crisis was actually
imminent. Doomsdorf’s mood was an uncertain
thing at best; and lately it had taken a turn
for the worse. He was not getting the satisfaction
that he had anticipated out of Ned’s slavery; the
situation had lost its novelty, and he was open to
any Satanic form of diversion that might occur to
him. Ned had mastered his trap lines, had stood
the gaff and was a better man on account of it; and
it was time his master provided additional entertainment
for him. In these dark, winter days he
remembered the Siberian prison with particular
vividness, and at such times the steely glitter was
more pronounced in his eyes, and certain things
that he had seen lingered ever in his mind. He
kept remembering strange ghosts of men, toiling
in the snow till they died, and souls that went out
screaming under the lash; and such remembrances
moved him with a dark, unspeakable lust. He
thought he would like to bring these memory-pictures
to life. Besides, his attitude toward Bess was
ever more sinister. He followed her motions with
a queer, searching, speculative gaze; and now and
then he offered her little favors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If he could only be held in restraint a few months
more. Ned knew perfectly that the longer the
crisis could be averted, the better his chance for life
and liberty. He would have more opportunity to
make preparations, to lay plans. Besides, every
day that he followed his trap line he was better
trained—in character and mind and body—for
the test to come. The work of bringing out Ned
Cornet’s manhood had never ceased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every day he had learned more of those savage
natural forces that find clearest expression in the
North. He knew the wind and the cold, snow-slide
and blizzard, but also he knew hunger and
fear and travail and pain. All these things taught
him what they had to teach, and all of them served
to shape him into the man he had grown to be. And
one still, clear afternoon the North sent home a
new realization of its power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was working that part of the line from his
Twelve-Mile cabin over the ridge toward the Forks
cabin,—his old rendezvous with Bess. He was
somewhat late in crossing the range to-day. He
had taken several of the larger fur-bearers and had
been obliged to skin them laboriously, first thawing
them out over a fire in the snow, so that midafternoon
found him just emerging from the thick copse
where he had killed the white wolf. The blazed trail
took him around the shoulder of the ridge, clear to
the edge of a little, deeply seamed glacier such as
crowns so many of the larger hills in the far North.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Few were the wild creatures that traversed this
icy desolation, so his trap line had been laid out
around the glacier, following the blazed trail in the
scrub timber. But to-day the long way round was
particularly grievous to his spirit. More than a
mile could be saved by leaving the timber and climbing
across the ice, and only a few sets, none of which
had ever proved especially productive, would be
missed. In his first few weeks the danger of going
astray had kept him close to his line, but he was not
obliged to take it into consideration now. He knew
his country end to end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without an instant’s hesitation he turned from
the trail straight over the snowy summit toward the
cabin. The cut-off would save him the annoyance
of making camp after dark. And since he had
climbed it once before, he scarcely felt the need of
extra caution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crossing, however, was not quite the same as
on the previous occasion. Before the ice had been
covered, completely across, with a heavy snowfall,
no harder to walk on than the open barrens. He
soon found now that the snow prevailed only to the
summit of the glacier, and the descent beyond the
summit had been swept clean by the winds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Below him stretched a half-mile of glare ice,
ivory white like the fangs of some fabulous beast-of-prey.
Here and there it was gashed with crevices,—those
deep glacier chasms into which a stone falls
in silence. For a moment Ned regarded it with
considerable displeasure:</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was not equipped for ice scaling. Perhaps it
was best not to try to go on. But as he waited, the
long way down and around seemed to grow in his
imagination. It was that deadly hour of late afternoon
when the founts of energy run low and the
thought-mechanism is dulled by fatigue;—and
some way, he felt his powers of resistance slipping
away from him. He forget, for the moment, the
<span class='it'>Fear</span> that is the very soul of wisdom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He decided to take a chance. He removed his
snowshoes and ventured carefully out upon the ice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was easier than it looked. His moccasins
clung very well. Steadily gaining confidence, he
walked at a faster pace. The slope was not much
on this side, the glacier ending in an abrupt cliff
many hundred feet in height, so he felt little need
of especial precaution. It was, in fact, the easiest
walking that he had had since his arrival upon the
island, so he decided not to turn off clear until he
reached the high ground just to one side of the ice
cliff. He crawled down a series of shelves, picked
his way about a jagged promontory, and fetched
up at last at the edge of a dark crevice scarcely fifty
feet from the edge of the snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crevice was not much over five feet wide at
this point, and looking along, he saw that a hundred
yards to his right it ended in a snowbank. But
there was no need of following it down. He could
leap it at a standing jump: with a running start
he could bound ten feet beyond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was tired, eager to get to camp,—and this
was the zero hour. He drew back three paces,
preparatory to making the leap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he halted he was somewhat amazed at the incredible
depth of silence that enthralled this icy
realm. It seemed to him, except for the beat of his
own heart, the absolute zero of silence,—not a
whimper of wind or the faintest rustle of whisking
snow dust. All the wilderness world seemed to be
straining—listening. The man leaped forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that instant the North gave him some sign of
its power. His first running step was firm, but at
the second his moccasin failed to hold, slipping
straight back. He pitched forward on his hands
and knees, grasping at the hard, slippery ice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he had not realized his momentum. He experienced
a strange instant of hovering, of infinite
suspense; and then the realization, like a flash of
lightning, of complete and immutable disaster.
There was no sense of fast motion. He slid rather
slowly, with that sickening helplessness that so
often characterizes the events of a tragic dream;
and the wilderness seemed still to be waiting, watching,
in unutterable indifference. Then he pitched
forward into the crevice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Ned it seemed beyond the least, last possibility
of hope that he should ever know another
conscious second. The glacier crevices were all incredibly
deep, and he would fall as a stone falls,
crushed at last on the lightless floor of the glacier
so far below that no sound might rise to disturb
this strange immensity of silence. It was always
thus with wilderness deaths. There is no sign that
the Red Gods ever see. All things remain as they
were,—the eternal silence, the wild creatures absorbed
in their occupations; the trees never lifting
their bowed heads from their burdens of snow.
Ned did not dream that mortal eyes would ever
rest upon his form again, vanishing without trace
except for the axe that had fallen at the edge of the
crevice and the imprint of his snowshoes on the
trail behind. There was no reason in heaven or
earth for doubting but that this ivory glacier would
be his sepulcher forever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In that little instant the scope of his mind was
incredibly vast. His thought was more clear and
true than ever before in his life, and it was faster
than the lightning in the sky. It reached back
throughout his years; it encompassed in full his
most subtle and intricate relations with life. There
was no sense of one thought coming after another.
The focus of his attention had been immeasurably
extended; and all that he knew, and all that he was
and had been, was before his eyes in one great, infinite
vista.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He still had time in plenty to observe the immensity
of the silence; the fact that his falling had
not disturbed, to the least fraction of a degree, the
vast imperturbability of the stretching snow fields
about him. In that same instant, because of the
seeming certainty of his end, he really escaped from
fear. Fear in its true sense is a relation that living
things have with the uncertainties of the future: a
device of nature by which the species are warned
of danger, but it can serve no purpose when judgment
is signed and sealed. This was not danger
but seeming certainty; and the mind was too busy
with other subjects to give place to such a useless
thing as fear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the same token he could not truly be said to
hope. Hope also is the handmaiden of uncertainty.
Glancing back, there was no great sense of regret.
Seemingly dispatched irrevocably out of the world,
in that flash of an instant he was suddenly almost
indifferent toward it. He remembered Lenore
clearly, seeing her more vividly than he had ever
seen her before, but she was like an old photograph
found buried in a forgotten drawer,—recalling
something that was of greatest moment once, but
which no longer mattered. Perhaps, seemingly facing
certain death, he was as one of the dead, seeing
everything in the world from an indifferent and
detached viewpoint.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All these thoughts swept him in a single fraction
of an instant as he plunged into darkness. And
all of them were unavailing. The uncertainty that
shadows the lives of men held sway once more; and
with it a ghastly and boundless terror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was not to die at once. There was still hope
of life. He fetched up, as if by a miracle, on an icy
shelf ten feet below the mouth of the crevice,—with
sheer walls rising on each side.</p>

<div><h1>XXIV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Ned</span> knew what fear was, well enough, as he lay
in the darkened chasm, staring up at the white line
of the crevice above him. The old love of life welled
back, sweeping his spirit as in a flood, and with it
all the hopes and fears of which life is made. He
remembered Lenore, now. Her image was not just
a lovely photograph of a past day,—a silvery
daguerreotype of a happiness forgotten. He remembered
again his debt of service to her, his dear
companionship for Bess, his dreams of escape from
the island. Rallying his scattered faculties, he tried
to analyze his desperate position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shelf on which he had fallen was scarcely
wider than his body, and only because it projected
at an upward incline from the sheer wall had he
come to rest upon it. It was perhaps fifty feet
long, practically on a level all the way. The wall
was sheer for ten feet above him; beyond the shelf
was only the impenetrable darkness of the crevice,
extending apparently into the bowels of the earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Could he climb the wall? There was no other
conceivable possibility of rescue. No one knew
where he was; no one would come to look for him.
Moreover, his escape must be immediate,—within
a few hours at most. There was no waiting for
Doomsdorf to come to look for him in the morning
light. He was dressed in the warmest clothes, but
even these could not repel the frightful cold of the
glaciers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cool-headed, with perfect self-mastery, he
shifted himself on the ledge to determine if he had
been injured in the fall. He was drawn and shuddering
with pain, but that alone was not an index.
Often the more serious injuries result in a temporary
paralysis that precludes pain. If any bones
were broken he was beaten at the start. But his
arms and legs moved in obedience to his will, and
there seemed nothing to fear from this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very cautiously, in imminent danger of pitching
backward into the abyss, he climbed to his feet. He
was a tall man, but his hands, reaching up, did not
come within two feet of the ledge. And there was
nothing whatever for his hands to cling to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If only there were irregularities in the ice. With
a surge of hope he thought of his axe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This tool, however, had either fallen into the
crevice or had dropped from his shoulder and lay
on the ice above. But there remained his clasp
knife. He drew it carefully from his pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Already he felt the icy chill of the glacier stealing
through him, the cold fingers of death itself. He
must lose no time in going to work. He began to
cut, two feet above the ledge, a sharp-edged hole in
the ice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brittle ice is not easy to cut with a knife. It
was a slow, painful process. He knew at once that
he must work with care,—any irregular cut would
not give him foothold. But Ned was working for
his life; and his hand was facile as never before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He finished the cut at last, then started on another
a foot above. He hewed out a foothold with
great care.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of his warm gloves and the hard exercise
of cutting, the numbing, biting frost was getting
to his fingers. But he mustn’t let his hand grow
stiff and awkward. He did not forget that the
handholds, to which his fingers must cling, were
yet to be made. They had to be finished with even
greater skill than the footholds. Very wisely, he
turned to them next.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He made the first of them as high as he could
reach. Then he put one in about a foot below.
Three more footholds were put in at about twelve-inch
intervals between.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that point he found it necessary to stop and
spend a few of his precious moments in rest. He
must not let fatigue dull him and take the cunning
from his hand. But the first stage of the work was
done;—deliverance looked already immeasurably
nearer. If he could climb up, then cling on and
cut a new hold! Placing the knife between his
teeth, he put his moccasin into the first foothold and
pulled himself up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It did not take long, however, to convince him
that the remaining work bordered practically on
the impossible. These holes in the ice were not like
irregularities in stone. The fingers slipped over
them: it was almost impossible to cling on with both
hands, much less one. But clinging with all his
might, he tried to free his right hand to procure his
knife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He made it at last, and at a frightful cost of
nervous energy succeeded in cutting some sort of a
gash in the icy wall above his head. Standing so
close he could not look up, it was impossible to do
more than hack out a ragged hole. And because
life lay this way and no other, he put the blade
once more between his teeth, reached his right
hand into the hole, and tried to pull himself up
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But disaster, bitter and complete, followed that
attempt. His numbing hands failed to hold under
the strain, and he slipped all the way back to his
shelf. Something rang sharply against the ice
wall, far below him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not hear it again; but the truth went
home to him in one despairing instant. Try as hard
as he could, his jaws had released their hold upon
the knife, and it had fallen into the depths of the
crevice below. He was not in the least aware of
the vicious wound its blade had cut in his shoulder,
of the warm blood that was trickling down under
his furs. He only knew, with that cold fatalism
with which the woodsman regards life, that he had
fought a good fight,—and he had lost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no use of trying any more. He had
no other knife or axe, no tool that could hack a hole
in the icy wall. What other things he carried about
him—the furs on his back, his box of safety
matches, and other minor implements of his trade—could
not help him in the least. And soon it
became increasingly difficult to think either upon
the fight he had made or the fate that awaited him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was hard to remember anything but the growing
cold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It hurt worst in his hands. So he took to rubbing
his hands together, hard as he could. He felt
the blood surge back into them, and soon they were
fairly warm in the great mittens of fur.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Directly he settled back on his icy shelf and drew
the pelts he had taken that day over his shoulders.
There was but one hope left; and such as it was, it
was curiously allied with despair. He hoped that
he had heard true that when frost steals into the
veins it comes with gentleness and ease. Perhaps
he would simply go to sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It wouldn’t be a long time. In fact, a great
drowsiness, not unpleasant but rather peaceful,
was already settling upon him. The cold of the
glacier was deadly. Not many moments remained
of his time on earth. The death that dwells in the
Arctic ice is mercifully swift.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had counted on hours, at least. He had even
anticipated lingering far into the night. But this
was only <span class='it'>moments</span>! The cleft above him was still
distinctly gray.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ice was creeping again into his fingers. But
he wouldn’t try to shake it out again. And now,
little, stabbing blades of cold were beginning to
pierce his heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But likely he would go to sleep before they really
began to trouble him. The northern night deepened
around him. The wind sprang up and moved
softly over the pale ice above him. The day was
done.</p>

<div><h1>XXV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Bess</span> had made good time along her line that day.
She had not forgotten that this was the day of her
rendezvous with Ned, and by walking swiftly, eschewing
even short rests, carrying her larger
trophies into the cabin to skin rather than halting
and thawing them out over a fire, she arrived at the
Forks hut at midafternoon. She began at once to
make preparations for Ned’s coming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She built a roaring fire in the little, rusted stove,
knowing well the blessing it would be to the tired
trapper, coming in with his load of furs. She
started supper so that the hot meal would be ready
upon his arrival. Then she began to watch the hillside
for his coming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It always gave her a pleasant glow to see the
little, moving spot of black at the edge of the timber.
Because of a vague depression that she had
been unable all day to shake off, she anticipated it
especially now. They always had such cheery
times together, perched on opposite sides of the little
stove. To Bess they redeemed the whole, weary
week of toil. It was true that their relations were
of companionship only; but this was dear enough.
If, long ago, her dreams had gone out to him with
deeper meaning, surely she had conquered them by
now,—never to set her heart leaping at a friendly
word, never to carry her, at the edge of slumber,
into a warm, beloved realm of exquisite fancy.
Bess had undergone training too. These days in
the snow had strengthened her and steeled her to
face the truth; and even, in a measure, to reconcile
herself to the truth. She had tried to make her heart
content with what she had, and surely she was beginning
to succeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned was a little past his usual time to-night.
Her depression deepened, and she couldn’t fight it
off. This North was so remorseless and so cruel,
laying so many pitfalls for the unsuspecting. It
was strange what blind terror swept through her at
just the thought of disaster befalling Ned. It
made her doubt herself, her own mastery of her
heart. She never considered the dangers that lay
in her own path, only those in his. At the end of a
miserable hour she straightened, scarcely able to
believe her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the glare ice of the glacier, a mile straight up
the ridge from the cabin, she saw the figure of a
man. Far as it was, one glance told her it was not
merely a creature of the wild, a bear disturbed in
his winter sleep or a caribou standing facing her.
It was Ned, of course, taking the perilous path
over the ice, instead of keeping to the blazed trail
of his trap line. On the slight downward slope toward
her, clearly outlined against the white ice, she
could see every step he took.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was walking boldly over the glassy surface.
Didn’t he know its terrors, the danger of slipping
on the icy shelves and falling to his death, the deep
crevices shunned by the wild creatures? She
watched every step with anxious gaze. When he
was almost to safety she saw him stop, draw back
a few paces, and then come forward at a leaping
pace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What happened thereafter came too fast for her
eyes to follow. One instant she saw his form distinctly
as he ran. The next, and the ice lay white
and bare in the wan light, and Ned had disappeared
as if by a magician’s magic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For one moment she gazed in growing horror.
There was no ice promontory behind which he was
hidden, nor did he reappear again. And peering
closely, she made out a faint, dark line, like a pencil
mark on the ice, just where Ned had disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The truth went home in a flash. The dark line
indicated a crevice, to the bottom of which no living
thing may fall and live. Yet to such little wild
creatures, red-eyed ermine and his fellows that
might have been watching her from the snow in
front, Bess gave no outward sign that she had seen
or that she understood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stood almost motionless at first. Her eyes
were toneless, lightless holes in her white face; the
face itself seemed utterly blank. She seemed to be
drawing within herself, into an eerie dream world
of her own, as if seeking shelter from some dire,
unthinkable thing that lay without. She was
hardly conscious, as far as the usual outward consciousness
is concerned; unaware of herself, unaware
of the snow fields about her and the deepening
cold; unaware of the onward march of time.
She seemed like a child, hovering between life and
death in the scourge of some dread, childhood
malady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly her lips drew in a smile; a smile ineffably
sweet, tender as the watch of angels. It was as if
the dying child had smiled to reassure its sobbing
mother, to tell her that all was well, that she must
dry her tears. “It isn’t true,” she whispered, there
in the stillness. “It couldn’t be true—not to Ned.
There is some way out—some mistake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned into the cabin, bent, and added fresh
fuel to the stove. Its heat scorched her face, and
she put up her hand to shield it. The cabin should
be warm, when she brought Ned home. She
mustn’t let the cold creep in. She must not forget
the <span class='it'>cold</span>, always watching for every little opening.
Perhaps he would want food too: she glanced into
the iron pot on the stove. Then, acting more by
instinct than by conscious thought, she began to
look about for such tools as she would need in the
work to follow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a piece of rope, used once on a hand
sled, hanging on the wall; but it was only about
eight feet in length. Surely it was not long enough
to aid her, yet it was all she had. Next, she removed
a blanket from her cot and threw it over her
shoulder. There might be need of this too,—further
protection against the cold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Heretofore she had moved slowly, hardly aware
of her own acts; but now she was beginning to master
herself again. She mustn’t linger here. She
must make her spirit waken to life, her muscles
spring to action. Carrying her rope and her blanket,
she went out the door, closed it behind her,
and started up toward the glacier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only one thing was real in that long mile; and
all things else were vague and shadowy as faces in
a remembered dream. The one reality was the
dark line, ever broader and more distinct, that lay
across the ice where Ned had disappeared. The
hope she had clung to all the way, that it was merely
a shallow hollow in the ice and not one of the dread
crevices that seem to go to the bowels of the earth,
was evidently without the foundation of fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Weary lifetimes passed away before ever she
reached the first, steep cliff of the glacier. She had
to follow along its base, on to the high ground toward
which Ned had been heading, finally crossing
back to the smooth table of the glacier itself. There
was no chance for a mistake now. The gash in the
ice was all too plain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last she stood at the very edge of the yawning
seam, staring down into the unutterable blackness
below. Not even <span class='it'>light</span> could exist in the murky
depths of the crevice, much less fragile human life.
The day was not yet dead, twilight was still gray
about her; but the crevice itself seemed full of ink
clear to its mouth. And Ned’s axe, lying just
at the edge of the chasm, showed where he had
fallen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no use of seeking farther; of calling
into the lightless depths. The story was all too
plain. Very quietly, she lay down on the ice, trying
to peer into the blackness below; but it was with
no hope of bringing the fallen back to her again.
Ned was lost to her, as a falling star is lost to the
star clusters in the sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It never occurred to her that she would ever get
upon her feet again. The game had been played
and lost. There was no need of braving the snow
again, of fighting her way down the trap line in the
bitter dawns. The star she had followed had fallen;
the flame of her altar had burned out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She knew now why she had ever fought the fight
at all. It was not through any love of life, or any
hope of deliverance in the end. It had all been for
Ned. She had denied it before, but the truth was
plain enough now. It was her love for Ned that
had kept her shoulders straight under the killing
labor, had sheltered her spirit from the curse of cold
and storm, that had borne her aloft out of the power
of this savage land to harm. She knew now why
she had not given up long since.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Was that the way of woman’s heart, to sustain
her through a thousand unutterable miseries only
that she might be crushed in the end? Was life no
more than this? She had been content to live on,
to endure all, just to be near him and watch over
him to the end; but there was no need of lingering
now. The fire in the cabin could burn down, and
the fire of her spirit could flicker out in the ever-deepening
cold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had tried to blind herself to the truth, yet
always, in the secret places of her soul, she had
known. It was not that she ever had hope of Ned’s
love. Lenore would get that: Ned’s devotion to
her had never faltered yet. But it was enough just
to be near, to work beside him, to care for him to the
full limit of her mortal power. She knew now that
all the tears she had shed had been for him: not for
the lash of cold on her own body, but on his; not for
her own miseries, but those that had so often
brought Ned clear into the shadow of death. And
now the final blow had fallen. She could lie still on
the ice and let the wind cry by in triumph above her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had loved every little moment with him, on
the nights of their rendezvous. She had loved him
even at first, before ever his manhood came upon
him, but her love had been an infinite, an ineffable
thing in these last few weeks of his greatness. She
had watched his slow growth; every one of his victories
had been a victory to her; and she had loved
every fresh manifestation of his new strength. But
oh, she had loved his boyishness too. His queer,
crooked smile, his brown hair curling over his brow,
his laugh and his eyes,—all had moved her and
glorified her beyond any power of hers to tell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She called his name into the chasm depths, and
some measure of self-control returned to her when
she heard the weird, rolling echo. Perhaps she
shouldn’t give up yet. It wouldn’t be Ned’s way
to yield to despair until the last, faint flame of hope
had burned out. Perhaps the crevice was not of
such vast depth as she had been taught to believe.
Perhaps even now the man she loved was lying,
shattered but not dead, only a few feet below her in
the darkness. She had come swiftly; perhaps the
deadly cold had not yet had time to claim him. She
called again, loudly as she could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And that cry did not go unheard. Ned had
given up but a few moments before Bess had come,
and her full voice carried clearly into the strange,
misty realm of semi-consciousness into which he had
drifted. And this manhood that had lately grown
upon him would not let him shut his ears to this sobbing
appeal. His own voice, sounding weird and
hollow as the voice of the dead in that immeasurable
abyss, came back in answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here I am, Bess,” he said. “You’ll have to
work quick.”</p>

<div><h1>XXVI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> was bitter hard for Ned to fight his way back
through death’s twilight. The cold had hold of
him, its triumph was near, and it would not let him
go without a savage battle that seemed to wrack the
man in twain. So far as his own wishes went, he
only wanted to drift on, farther and farther into the
twilight ocean, and never return to the cursed island
again. But Bess was calling him, and he couldn’t
deny her. Perhaps in a distant cabin Lenore called
him too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Indeed, the call upon him was more urgent than
ever before. Before, his thought had always been
for Lenore, but Bess too was a factor now. In that
utter darkness Ned saw more clearly than ever before
in his life, and while his eyes searched only for
Lenore, he kept seeing Bess too. Bess with her
never-failing smile of encouragement, her soft
beauty that had held him, in spite of himself, on
their nights at Forks cabin. Her need of him was
real, threatened by Doomsdorf as she was, and he
mustn’t leave her sobbing so forlornly on the ice
above. Lenore was first, of course,—his duty to
her reason enough for making a mighty fight. But
Bess’s pleading moved him deeply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He summoned every ounce of courage and determination
that he had and tried to shake the frost
from his brain. “You’ll have to work quick,” he
warned again. His voice was stronger now, but
softened with a tenderness beyond her most reckless
dreams. “Don’t be too hopeful—I haven’t much
left in me. What can you do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl who answered him was in no way the lost
and hopeless mortal that had lain sobbing on the ice.
Her scattered, weakened faculties had swept back
to her in all their strength, at the first sound of his
voice. <span class='it'>He was alive</span>, and it is the code of the North,
learned in these dreadful months, that so long as a
spark still glows the battle must not be given over.
There was something to fight for now. The fighting
side of her that Ned had seen so often swept
swiftly into dominance. At once she was a cold
blade, true and sure; brain and body in perfect discipline.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How far are you?” she asked. “I can’t
see——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About ten feet—but I can’t get up without
help.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you stand up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.” Forcing himself to the last ounce of his
nerve and courage, he drew himself erect. Reaching
upward, his hands were less than a yard from
the top of the crevice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bess did not make the mistake of trying to reach
down to him. She conquered the impulse at once,
realizing that any weight at all, unsupported as she
was, would draw her into the ravine. Even the
rope would be of no use until she had something
firm to which to attach it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve dug holes most of the way up,” he
told her. “I might try to climb ’em, with a little
help——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you at the bottom of the crevice?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The bottom is hundreds of feet below me. I’m
on a ledge about three feet wide.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then stand still till I can really help you. I
can’t pull you now without being pulled in myself,
and if you’d fall back you’d probably roll off the
ledge. The ice is like glass. Ned, are you good for
ten minutes more——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the only chance.” Again her tone was
pleading. “Keep the blood moving for ten minutes
more, Ned. Oh, tell me you’ll try——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Deep in the gloom she thought she heard him
laugh—only a few, little syllables, wan and
strange in the silence—and it was all the answer
she needed. He would fight on for ten minutes
more. He would struggle against the cold until
she could rescue him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here’s a blanket,” she told him swiftly. “Put
it around you, if you can, without danger of rolling
off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She dropped him the great covering she had
brought; then in a single, deerlike motion, she
leaped the narrow crevice. On the opposite side
she procured Ned’s axe; then she turned, and half
running, half gliding on the ice, sped toward the
nearest timber,—a number of stunted spruce
two hundred yards distant at the far edge of the
glacier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bess had need of her woodsman’s knowledge
now. Never before had her blows been so true, so
telling on the tough wood. Before, in the fuel cutting
of months before, she had wielded the axe in
fear of the lash, but to-day she worked for Ned’s
life, for the one dream that mattered yet. Almost
at once she had done her work and was started back
with a tough pole, eight feet long and four inches in
diameter, balanced on her sturdy shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned was still strong enough to answer her call
when she returned, and the dim light still permitted
him to see her lay the pole she had cut as a bridge
across the crevice, cutting notches in the ice to hold
it firm. Swiftly she tied one end of her rope to the
pole and dropped the other to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you climb up?” she asked him. Everything
had centered down to this—whether he still
had strength to climb the rope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just watch me,” was the answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From that instant, she knew that she had won.
The spirit behind his words would never falter, with
victory so near. He dug his moccasins into the
holes he had hacked in the ice, meanwhile working
upward, hand over hand. To fall meant to die,—but
Ned didn’t fall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a hard fight, weakened as he was, but soon
the girl’s reaching hands caught his sleeve, then his
coat; finally they were fastened firmly, lifting with
all the girl’s strength, under the great arms. His
hand seized the pole, and he gave a great upward
lunge. And then he was lying on the ice beside
her, fighting for breath, not daring to believe that
he was safe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the usual cool, half-mirthful remark that, in
many little crises, Ned had learned to expect from
Bess was not forthcoming to-night. Nor were the
sounds in the twilight merely those of heavy breathing.
The strain was over, and Bess had given way
to the urge of her heart at last. Her tears flowed
unchecked, whether of sorrow or happiness even she
did not know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man crawled toward her, moved by an urge
beyond him, and for a single moment his strong
arms pressed her close. “Don’t cry, little pal,” he
told her. He smiled, a strangely boyish, happy
smile, into her eyes. Very softly, reverently he
kissed her wet eyelids, then stilled her trembling lips
with his own. He smiled again, a great good-humor
taking hold of him. “You’re too big a girl to
cry!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was he, to-night, who had to relieve with humor
a situation that would have soon been out of bounds.
Yet all at once he saw that the little sentence had
meaning far beyond what he had intended. She
<span class='it'>had</span> shown bigness to-night,—a greatness of spirit
and strength that left him wondering and reverent.
The battle she had fought to save his life was no less
than his own waged with the white wolf, weeks before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here was another who had stood the gaff! She
too knew what it was to take the fighting chance.
Presently he knew, by light of this adventure on the
ice, that Bess was more than mere companion in toil
and hardship, some one to shelter and protect. She
was a <span class='it'>comrade-at-arms</span>,—such a fortress of
strength as the best of women have always been to
the men they loved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not know whether or not she loved him.
It didn’t affect the point that, in a crisis, she had
shown the temper of her steel! He did not stand
alone henceforth. In the struggle for freedom
that was to come here was an ally on whom, to the
very gates of death, he could implicitly rely.</p>

<div><h1>XXVII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>When</span> food and warmth had brought complete
recovery, Ned took up with Bess the problem of
deliverance from the island. He found that for
weeks she had been thinking along the same line,
and like him, she had as yet failed to hit upon any
plan that offered the least chance for success. The
subject held them late into the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no need of a formal pact between
them. Each of them realized that if ever the
matter came to the crisis, the other could be relied
upon to the last ditch. They stood together on
that. Whatever the one attempted, the other would
carry through. And because of their mutual trust,
both felt more certain than ever of their ultimate
triumph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They took different trails in the dawn, following
the long circle of their trap lines. All the way they
pondered on this same problem, conceiving a plan
only to reject it because of some unsurmountable
obstacle to its success; dwelling upon the project
every hour and dreaming about it at night. But
Ned was far as ever from a conclusion when, three
days later, he followed the beach on the way to the
home cabin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had watched with deadened interest the
drama of the wild things about him these last days;
but when he was less than a mile from home he had
cause to remember it again. To his great amazement
he found at the edge of the ice the fresh track
of one of the large island bears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was nothing to tell for sure what had awakened
the great creature prematurely from its winter
sleep. The expected date of awakening was still
many weeks off. But the grizzly is notoriously irregular
in his habits; and experienced naturalists
have long since ceased to be surprised at whatever
he may do. Ned reasoned at once that the present
mild weather had merely beguiled the old veteran
from his lair (the size of the track indicated a patriarch
among the bears) and he was simply enjoying
the late winter sunlight until a cold spell should
drive him in again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sight of the great imprint was a welcome one
to Ned, not alone because the wakening forecasted,
perhaps, an early spring, but because he was in immediate
need of bear fur. His own coat was worn;
besides, he was planning a suit of cold-proof garments
for Lenore, to be used perhaps in their final
flight across the ice. And he saw at once that conditions
were favorable for trapping the great creature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scarcely a quarter of a mile ahead, in a little pass
that led through the shore crags down to the beach,
Doomsdorf had left one of his most powerful bear
traps. Ned had seen it many times as he had clambered
through on a short cut to the cabin. Because
it lay in a natural runway for game—one of the
few spots where the shore crags could be easily surmounted—it
was at least possible that the huge
bear might fall into it, on his return to his lair in the
hills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned hurried on, and in a few moments had dug
out the great trap from its covering of snow. For
a moment he actually doubted his power to set it.
It was of obsolete type, mighty-springed, and its
jaws were of a width forbidden by all laws of trapping
in civilized lands, yet Ned did not doubt its
efficiency. Its mighty irons had rusted; but not
even a bear’s incalculable might could shatter them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was not to be a bait set, so his success depended
upon the skill with which he concealed the
trap. First he carefully refilled the excavation he
had made in digging out the trap; then he dug a
shallow hole in the snow in the narrowest part of
the pass. Here he set the trap, utilizing all the
power of his mighty muscles, and spread a light covering
of snow above.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a delicate piece of work. Ned had no
wish for the cruel jaws to snap shut as he was working
above them. But his heart was in the venture,
for all his hatred of the cruelty of the device; and
he covered up his tracks with veteran’s skill. Then
he quietly withdrew, retracing his steps and following
the shore line toward the home cabin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Surely the mighty strength that had set the powerful
spring and the skill that covered up all traces
of his work could succeed at last in freeing him from
slavery.</p>

<hr class='tbk102'/>

<p class='pindent'>Bess had reached the shelter first, and she was
particularly relieved to see Ned’s tall form swinging
toward her along the shore. Doomsdorf was in
a particularly ominous mood to-night. The curious
glitter in his magnetic eyes was more pronounced
than she had ever seen it,—catlike in the
shadows, steely in the lantern light; and his cruel
savagery was just at the surface, ready to be
wakened. Worst of all, the gaze he bent toward
her was especially eager to-night, horrible to her as
the cold touch of a reptile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every time she glanced up she found him regarding
her, and he followed her with his eyes when she
moved. Yet she dared not seek shelter in the new
cabin, for the simple reason that she was afraid
Doomsdorf would follow her there. Until Ned
came, her defense was solely the presence of Lenore
and the squaw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no particular warmth in her meeting
with Ned. Doomsdorf’s eyes were still upon her,
and she was careful to keep any hint of the new
understanding out of her face and eyes. Ned’s
weather-beaten countenance was as expressionless
as Sindy’s own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He refused to be depressed, at once, by the air of
suspense and impending disaster that hung over the
cabin. Thus was the day of his home-coming—looked
forward to throughout the bitter days of his
trap line—and was not Lenore waiting, beautiful
in the lantern light, for him to speak to her? Yet
the old exultation was somehow missing to-night.
His thoughts kept turning back to the pact he had
made with Bess—to their dream of deliverance.
What was more curious, Lenore’s lack of warmth
that had come to be a matter of course in their
weekly meetings almost failed to hurt. His mind
was so busy with the problem of their freedom that
he escaped the usual despondency that had crept
upon him so many times before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a peculiar paradox that while this was his
day of days, the one day in five that seemed to justify
his continued life, it was always the most hopeless
and miserable, simply because of Lenore’s attitude
toward him. It wasn’t entirely her failure to
respond to his own ardor. The inevitable disappointment
lay as much in his own attitude toward
her. It was as much the things she did as those she
failed to do that depressed him; the questions she
asked, her patronage of Bess, her self-pitying complaints.
Always he experienced a sense of some
great omission,—perhaps only his failure to feel
the old delight and exultation that the mere fact of
her presence used to impart to him. He found it
increasingly hard to give full attention to her; to let
his eyes dwell always on her beauty and his ears give
heed to her wrongs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She found him preoccupied, and as a result increased
her complaints. But they left him cold to-night.
Her lot was happiness itself compared to
that of Bess, and yet Bess’s spirit of good sportsmanship
and courage was entirely absent in her.
But he must not keep comparing her with Bess.
Destruction lay that way! He must continue to
adore her for her beauty, the charm that used to
hold him entranced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was all he had asked for in his old life. If
they ever gained freedom, he would, in all probability,
find in her all that he could desire in the future.
They could take up their old love anew, and doubtless
she would give him all the happiness he had a
right to expect—more than he deserved. Likely
enough, if the test ever came, she would show that
her metal too was the finest, tempered steel! At
least he could continue to believe in her until he had
cause to lose faith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the test was not far distant now. He was
not blind to the gathering storm; at any moment
there might ensue a crisis that would embroil all
three of them in a struggle to the death. Not one
of them could escape, Lenore no more than himself
or Bess. She was one of the triumvirate,—and
surely she would stand with them to the last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the crisis could only be postponed until they
had made full preparations for it! Yet in one
glance, in which he traced down Doomsdorf’s fiery
gaze and found it centered upon Bess, he knew that
any instant might bring the storm!</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt his own anger rising. A dark fury,
scarcely controllable, swept over him at the insult of
that creeping, serpent gaze upon Bess’s beauty.
But he mustn’t give way to it yet. He must hold
himself for the last, dread instant of need.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The four of them gathered about the little, rough
table, and again the squaw served them, from the
shadows. It was a strange picture, there in the
lantern light,—the imperturbable face of the
squaw, always half in shadow; the lurid wild-beast
eyes of Doomsdorf gleaming under his shaggy
brows; Lenore’s beauty a thing to hold the eyes;
and Bess horrified and fearful at what the next moment
might bring. Hardly a word was exchanged
from the meal’s beginning to its end. Bess tried to
talk, so as to divert Doomsdorf’s sinister thoughts,
but the words would not come to her lips. The
man seemed eager to finish the meal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as they had moved from the table toward
the little stove, and the squaw had begun the work
of clearing away the dishes, Doomsdorf halted at
Bess’s side. For a moment he gazed down at her, a
great hand resting on her chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a pretty little hell-cat,” he told her, in
curiously muffled tones. “What makes you such a
fighter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She tried to meet his eyes. “I have to be, in this
climate,” she answered. “Where would you get
your furs——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He uttered one great hoarse syllable, as if in the
beginning of laughter. “That’s not what I mean,
and you know it. You’d sooner walk ten miles
through the snow than give an inch, wouldn’t you?”
His hand reached, closing gently upon her arm, and
a shiver of repulsion passed over her. “That’s a
fine little muscle—but you don’t want to work it
off. Why don’t you show a little friendship?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl looked with difficulty into his great,
drawn face. Ned stiffened, wondering if the moment
of crisis were at hand at last. Lenore watched
appalled, but the native went on about her tasks as
if she hadn’t heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t expect—much friendship—from a
prisoner,” Bess told him brokenly. Her face, so
white in the yellow lantern light, her trembling lips,
most of all the appeal for mercy in her child’s eyes—raised
to this beast compared with whom even
the North was merciful—wakened surging, desperate
anger in Ned. The room turned red before
his eyes, his muscles quivered, and he was rapidly
reaching that point wherein his self-control, on
which life itself depended, was jeopardized. Yet
he must hold himself with an iron hand. He must
wait to the last instant of need. Everything depended
on that, in avoiding the crisis until he had
made some measure of preparation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The loss of his long-bladed skinning knife increased
the odds against him. He had put considerable
reliance in its hair-splitting blade; and since
he had perfected the sheath of caribou leather
whereby he could keep it open in his pocket, he had
hoped that it might be the means of freedom. In
the three days since its loss he had been obliged to
carry one of the butcher knives from the supplies at
Forks cabin,—a sharp enough implement, but
without the dagger point that would be so deadly in
close work. However, he moved his arm so that he
could reach the hilt of the knife in one motion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But with the uncanny watchfulness of a cat
Doomsdorf saw the movement. For one breath
Ned’s life was suspended by a hair: Doomsdorf’s
first impulse was to seize his pistol and bore the
younger man through and through with lead. It
was a mere madman’s whim that he refrained: he
had a more entertaining fate in store for Ned when
affairs finally reached a crisis. He leered down in
contempt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your little friend seems to be getting nervous,”
he remarked easily to Bess. “So not to disturb
him further, let’s you and I go to the new cabin.
I’ve taken some fine pelts lately—I want you to
see them. You need a new coat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He seemed to be aware of the gathering suspense,
and it thrilled his diseased nerves with exultation.
But there was, from his listeners, but one
significant response at first to the evil suggestion
that he made with such iniquitous fires in his wild
eyes and such a strange, suppressed tone in his
voice. Bess’s expression did not change. It had
already revealed the uttermost depths of dread.
Ned still held himself, cold, now, as a serpent, waiting
for his chance. But the squaw paused a single
instant in her work. For one breath they failed to
hear the clatter of her pans. But seemingly indifferent,
she immediately went back to her toil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bess shook her head in desperate appeal. “Wait
till morning,” she pleaded. “I’m tired now——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned saw by the gathering fury of their master’s
face that her refusal would only bring on the crisis,
so he leaped swiftly into the breach. “Sure, Bess,
let’s go to look at them,” he said. “I’m anxious to
see ’em too——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Doomsdorf whirled to him, and his gaze was as a
trial of fire to Ned. Yet the latter did not flinch.
For a long second they regarded each other in implacable
hatred, and then Doomsdorf’s sudden start
told that he had been visited by inspiration. His
leering look of contempt was almost a smile.
“Sure, come along,” he said. “I’ve got something
to say to you too. To spare Lenore’s feelings—we’ll
go to the other cabin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned was not in the least deceived by this reference
to Lenore. Doomsdorf had further cause,
other than regard for Lenore’s sensibilities, for continuing
their conversation in the other cabin. What
it was Ned did not know, and he dared not think.
And he had a vague impression that while he and
Doomsdorf had waged their battle of eyes, Bess had
mysteriously moved from her position. He had
left her just at Doomsdorf’s right; when he saw her
again she was fully ten feet distant, within a few
feet of the cupboards where the squaw kept many
of the food supplies, and now was busy with her
parka of caribou skin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She led the way out into the clear, icy night. It
was one of those still, clear, late winter evenings,
not so cold as it had been, when the frozen, snow-swept
world gave no image of reality to the senses.
The snow wastes and the velvet depths of the sky
were lurid, flashing with a thousand ever-changing
hues from the giant kaleidoscope of the Northern
Lights. Moved and held by this wonder that never
grows old to the northern man, Doomsdorf halted
them just without the cabin door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they watched, the procession of colors suddenly
ceased, leaving world and sky an incredible
monochrome in red. It was wanly red at first, but
the warm hue slowly deepened until one could imagine
that the spirits of all the dead, aroused for
some cosmic holiday, were lighting flares of red fire.
It was a strange sight even for these latitudes; but
this lambent mystery is ever beyond the ken of man.
The name that Doomsdorf had given his island had
never seemed so fitting as now. In the carmine
glow the bearded face of the master of the isle was
suddenly the red-hued visage of Satan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the light died away at last, and the falling
darkness called them back to themselves. The lust
that fired Doomsdorf’s blood, the fear like the
Arctic cold in the veins of Ned and Bess was all
worldly enough. For a moment he studied their
pale, tense faces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no need of going farther,” he said in his
deep, rumbling voice. “There was no need of even
coming here. You seem to be forgetting, you two,
where you are—all the things I told you at first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paused, and his voice had dropped, and the
tone was strange and even, dreadful to hear, when
he spoke again. “I’ve evidently been too easy with
you,” he went on. “I’ll see that I correct that
fault in the future. You, Ned, made a serious mistake
when you interfered in this matter to-night.
I’ll see if I can’t teach you to keep your place.
And Bess—long ago I told you that your body
and your soul were mine—to do with what I liked.
You seemed to have forgotten—but I intend that
you will call it to mind—again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Ned still faced him when he paused, eyes
steadfast, his face an iron gray in the wan light.
His training had been hard and true, and he still
found strength to stand erect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to tell you this—in reply,” he answered
in the clear, firm voice of one who has mastered
fear. “We know well enough what you can do to
us. But that doesn’t mean that we’re going to yield
to you—to every one of your evil wishes. Life
isn’t so pleasant to either of us that we’ll submit
to everything in order to live. No matter what
you do to me—I know what I’ll do to you if
you try to carry out your wicked designs by
force.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Doomsdorf eyed him calmly, but the smile of contempt
was wholly gone from his lips. “You’ll
show fight?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With every ounce I’ve got! You may master
me—with every advantage of weapons and physical
strength—but you’ll have to kill me first.
Bess will kill herself before she’ll yield to you. You
won’t be better off—you’ll simply have no one to
do your trapping for you. It isn’t worth it,
Doomsdorf.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He eyed them a moment, coolly and casually.
“When I want anything, Ned, I want it bad
enough to pay all I’ve got for it,” he said in a remarkably
even tone. “Don’t presume that I value
your lives so much that I’ll turn one step from my
course. Besides, Ned—you won’t be here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned’s eyes widened, as he tried to read his meaning.
Doomsdorf laughed softly in the silence.
“You won’t be here!” he repeated. “You fool—do
you think I’d let you get in my way? It will
rest as it is to-night. To-morrow morning you
start out to tend your traps—and you will tend
Bess’s lines as well as your own. She will stay here—with
me—from now on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned felt his muscles hardening to steel. “I
won’t leave her to you——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You won’t? Don’t make any mistake on that
point. If you are not on your way by sun-up, you
get a hundred—from the <span class='it'>knout</span>. You won’t be
able to leave for some time after that—but neither
will you be able to interfere with what doesn’t concern
you. I’ll give you a few in the dawn—just
as a sample to show what they’re like. Nor am I
afraid of Bess killing herself. It’s cold and dark
here, but it’s colder and darker—There. She’ll
stand a lot before she’ll do that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s definite?” Ned asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The truest words I ever spoke. I’ve never
gone back on a promise yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And believe me, I won’t go back on mine. If
that’s all you have to say——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s quite all. Think it over—you’ll find
it isn’t so bad. And now—good night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He bowed to them, in mock politeness. Then
he turned back into his cabin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment his two prisoners stood inert, utterly
motionless in the wan light. Ned started to
turn to her, still held by his own dark thoughts,
but at the first glance of her white, set face he
whirled in the most breathless amazement. It was
in no way the stricken, terrified countenance that he
had seen a few moments before. The lips were
firm, the eyes deep and strange; even in the half-light
he could see her look of inexorable purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some great resolve had come to her,—some
sweeping emotion that might even be akin to hope.
Was she planning suicide? Was <span class='it'>that</span> the meaning
of this new look of iron resolution in her face? He
could conceive of no other explanation; in self-inflicted
death alone lay deliverance from Doomsdorf’s
lust. He dared not hope for any happier
freedom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He reached groping hands to hers. “You don’t
mean”—he gasped, hardly able to make his lips
move in speech—“you don’t intend——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To kill myself? Not yet, by a long way.” The
girl’s hand slipped cautiously out from the pocket
of her jacket, showing him what seemed to be a
small, square box of tin. But the light was too dim
for him to make out the words on the paper label.
“I got this from the shelf—just as we left the
cabin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hopeful tones in her voice was the happiest
sound Ned had heard since he had come to the
island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” he whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing very much—but yet—a chance for
freedom. Come into the cabin where we can scratch
a match.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They moved into the newer hut of logs, and there
Bess showed him the humble article in which lay
her hopes. It was merely a tin of fine snuff from
among Doomsdorf’s personal supplies.</p>

<div><h1>XXVIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Talking</span> in an undertone, not to be heard
through the log walls, Bess and Ned made their
hasty plans for deliverance. They gave no sign of
the excitement under which they worked. Seemingly
they were unshaken by the fact that life or
death was the issue of the next hour,—the realization
that the absolute crisis was upon them at
last. Bess did not recall, in word or look, the trying
experience just passed through. Like Ned she
was wholly self-disciplined, her mind moving cool
and sure. Never had their wilderness training
stood them in better stead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here, in the cabin they occupied, the assault
must be made. The reason was simply that their
plan was defeated at the outset if they attempted
to master Doomsdorf in the squaw’s presence. For
all her seeming impassiveness, she would be like a
panther in her lord’s defense: Bess had had full
evidence of that fact the first day in the cabin. And
it was easier to decoy Doomsdorf here than to attempt
to entice the squaw away from her own house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fact that their two enemies must be handled
singly required the united efforts of not only Ned
and Bess, but Lenore. Two must wait here, as in
ambush, and the third must make some pretext to
entice Doomsdorf from his cabin. This, the easiest
part of the work, could fall to Lenore. Both Ned
and Bess realized that in their own hands must lie
the success or failure of the actual assault.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The plan, on perfection, was really very simple.
As soon as Lenore came, she would be sent back to
the cabin to bring Doomsdorf. She would need no
further excuse than that Bess had asked to see him:
Ned’s knowledge of the brute’s psychology told
him that. The scene just past would be fresh in
his mind, and it would be wholly characteristic of
his measureless arrogance that he would at once assume
that Bess had come to terms. He would read
in the request a vindication of his own philosophy,
the triumph of his own ruthless methods; and it
would be balm to his tainted soul to come and hear
her beg forgiveness. Likely he would anticipate
complete surrender.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Neither of the two conspirators could do this part
of the work so well as Lenore. For Bess to summon
Doomsdorf herself was of course out of the
question; he might easily demand to hear her surrender
on the spot. If Ned went, inviting Doomsdorf
to a secret conference with Bess, he would invite
suspicion if he reëntered the newer cabin with
him; his obvious course would be to remain outside
and leave the two together. Besides, Lenore was
the natural emissary: a woman herself and thus
more likely chosen for woman’s delicate missions,
she was also closer to Doomsdorf than any other of
the three, the one most likely to act as a confidential
agent. Doomsdorf would certainly comply with
Bess’s request to meet him in her cabin. The fact
of the squaw’s presence would be sufficient explanation
to him why she would not care to confer
with him in his own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned would be waiting in the newer cabin when
Lenore and Doomsdorf returned. He would immediately
excuse himself and pass out the door, at
the same instant that Bess extended a chair for
Doomsdorf. And the instant that he was seated
Bess would dash a handful of the blinding snuff
into his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned’s axe leaned just without the cabin door.
Doomsdorf would notice it as he went in: otherwise
his suspicions might be aroused. And in his
first instant of agony and blindness, Ned would
seize the weapon, dash back through the door, and
make the assault.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The plan was more than a mere fighting chance.
It would take Doomsdorf off his guard. Ned had
full trust in Bess’s ability to do her part of the
work; as to his own, he would strike the life from
their brute master with less compassion than he
would slay a wolf. He could find no break, no
weak link in the project.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had scarcely perfected the plan before Lenore
appeared, on the way to her cot. Just an instant
she halted, her face and golden head a glory
in the soft light, as she regarded their glittering
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their eyes alone, luridly bright, told the story.
Perhaps Ned was slightly pale; nothing that could
not be explained by the inroads made upon him in
the critical hour just passed. Perhaps Bess was
faintly flushed at the cheek bones. But those cold,
shining eyes held her and appalled her. “What is
it?” she demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned moved toward her, reaching for her hands.
For a breath he gazed into her lovely face. “Bess
wants you to go—and tell Doomsdorf—to come
here,” he told her. His voice was wholly steady,
every word clearly enunciated; if anything, he
spoke somewhat more softly and evenly than usual.
“Just tell him that she wants to see him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She took her eyes from his, glancing about with
unmistakable apprehension.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” she demanded. “He doesn’t like to be
disturbed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He <span class='it'>will</span> be disturbed, before we’re done,” Ned
told her grimly. “Just say that—that she wants
to see him. He’ll come—he’ll merely think it has
to do with some business we’ve just been talking
over. Go at once, Lenore—before he goes to bed.
That’s your part—to bring him here. You can
leave him at the door if you like—you can even
stay at the other cabin while he comes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her searching eyes suddenly turned in fascinated
horror to Bess. Standing near the open door, so
that the room might not be filled with the dust of
the snuff and thus convey a warning to Doomsdorf,
she was emptying the contents of the snuff-box into
her handkerchief. Her eyes gleamed under her
brows, and her hands were wholly steady. Lenore
shivered a little, her hands pressing Ned’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does it mean——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Liberty! <span class='it'>That’s</span> what it means, if the plan
goes through.” For the first time Ned’s voice revealed
suppressed emotion. Liberty! He spoke
the word as a devout man speaks of God. “It’s the
only chance—now or never,” he went on with perfect
coldness. “You’ve got to hold up and do your
share—I know you can. If we succeed—and
we’ve got every chance—it’s freedom, escape from
this island and Doomsdorf. If we fail, it’s likely
death—but death couldn’t be any worse than this.
So we’ve nothing to lose—and everything to gain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Was it not true? Have not the greatest of all
peoples always known that it is better to die than
to live as slaves? It was the very slogan of the
ages—the great inspiration without which human
beings are not fit to live. Overswept by their ardor
Lenore turned back through the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her instructions were simple. The easiest task
of the three was hers. Bess took one of the crude
chairs, her handkerchief—clutched as if she had
been weeping—in her lap. Ned sat down in one
of the other chairs, intending to arise and excuse
himself the instant Doomsdorf appeared. His
muscles burned under his skin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was only about fifty yards to the cabin. If
Doomsdorf came at all, it would be in the space of
a few seconds. Lenore started out bravely: her
part of the task would be over in a moment. Just
a few steps in the glare of the Northern Lights,
just a few listless words to Doomsdorf, and liberty
might easily be her reward. All the triumphs she
had once known might be hers again; luxury instead
of hardship, flattery instead of scorn—freedom
instead of slavery. But what if the plan
failed? Ned had spoken bluntly, but beyond all
shadow of doubt he had told the truth. <span class='it'>Death</span>
would be the answer to all failure. Destruction for
all three.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door of the cabin closed behind her, and Lenore
was alone with the night. The night was
rather temperate, for these latitudes, yet her first
sensation was one of cold. It seemed to be creeping
into her spirit, laying its blasting hand upon her
heart. The stars appalled her, the Northern Lights
were unutterably dreadful. She tried to walk
faster, but instead she found herself walking more
slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wind stirred through the little spruce, whispering,
whimpering, trying to reach her ear with
messages to which she dared not listen, chilling her
to the core, appalling her with its hushed, half-articulate
song of woe and death. There was nothing
but Death on these snowy hills. It walked them
alone. It was Death that looked into her eyes now,
so close she could feel its icy hand on hers, its hollow
visage leering close to her own. Life might be
hateful, its persecutions never done, but Death was
darkness, oblivion, a mystery and a terror beyond
the reach of thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So faint that it seemed some secret voice within
her own being, the long-drawn singsong cry of a
starving wolf trembled down to her from a distant
ridge. Here was another who knew about Death.
He knew the woe and the travail that is life, utter
subservience to the raw forces of the North; and
yet he dared not die. This was the basic instinct.
Compared to it freedom was a feeble urge that was
soon forgotten. This whole wintry world was peopled
with living creatures who hated life and yet
who dared not leave it. The forces of the North
were near and commanding to-night: they were
showing her up, stripping her of her delusions, laying
bare the secret places of her heart and soul,
testing her as she had never been tested before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Could she too take the fighting chance? Could
she too rise above this awful first fear: master it,
scorn it, go her brave way in the face of it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>But before ever she found her answer, she found
herself at the cabin door. It seemed to her that she
had crossed the intervening distance on the wings of
the wind. In as short a time more Doomsdorf
could reach the newer cabin,—and the issue would
be decided. Either they would be free, or under
the immutable sentence of death; not just Bess and
Ned, but herself too. She would pay the price with
the rest. The wind would sweep over the island
and never hear her voice mingling with its own.
For her, the world would cease to be. The fire was
warm and kindly in the hearth, but she was renouncing
it, for she knew not what of cold and
terror. Not just Ned and Bess would pay the
price, but she too. Listless, terrified almost to the
verge of collapse, she turned the knob and opened
the door. Doomsdorf had not yet gone to his
blankets; otherwise the great bolt of iron would be
in place. He was still sitting before the great,
glowing stove, dreaming his savage dreams. The
girl halted before him, leaning against a chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first her tongue could hardly shape the words.
Her throat filled, her heart faltered in her breast.
“Bess—asked to see you,” she told him at last.
“She says for you to come—to her cabin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man regarded her with quickening interest,
yet without the slightest trace of suspicion. It
seemed almost incredible that he did not see the
withering terror behind those blanched cheeks and
starting eyes and immediately guess its cause: only
his own colossal arrogance saved the plot at the outset.
He was simply so triumphant by what seemed
to be Bess’s surrender, so drunk with his success in
handling a problem that at first had seemed so
difficult, that the idea of conspiracy could not even
occur to him. He hardly saw the girl before him;
if he had noticed her at first, she was forgotten at
once in his exultation. Even the lifeless tone in
which she spoke made no impression upon him: he
only heard her words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He got up at once. Lenore stared at him as if
in a nightmare. She had hoped in her deepest heart
that he would refuse to come, that the great test of
her soul could be avoided, but already he was starting
out the door. She had done her part; she could
wait here, if she liked, till the thing was settled. In
a few seconds more she would know her fate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet she couldn’t stay here and wait. To Doomsdorf’s
surprise, she followed him through the door,
into the glare of the Northern Lights. She did not
know what impulse moved her; she was only aware
of the growing cold of terror. Not only Ned and
Bess would pay the price if the plan failed. She
must pay too. The thought haunted her, every
step, every wild beat of her heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All her life her philosophy had been of Self.
And now, that Self was once more in the forefront
of her consciousness, she found her wild excitement
passed away, her brain working clear and sure.
The night itself terrified her no more. She was
beyond such imaginative fears as that: remembrance
of <span class='it'>Self</span>, her <span class='it'>own</span> danger and destiny, was
making a woman of her again. Only a fool forgot
<span class='it'>Self</span> for a dream. Only a madman risked dear life
for an ideal. Once more she was down to realities:
she was steadied and calmed, able to balance one
thing with another. And now she had at her command
a superlative craft, even a degree of cunning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She must not forget that lately her position had
been one of comparative comfort. She was a slave,
fawning upon a brute in human form, but the cold
had mostly spared her; and she knew nothing of the
terrible hardships that had been the share of Ned
and Bess. Yet she was taking equal risks with
them. It is better to live and hate life than to die;
it is better to be a living slave than a dead freeman.
Besides, lately she had been awarded even greater
comforts, won by fawning upon her master. Her
privileges would be taken swiftly from her if the
plan failed. She would not be able to persuade
Doomsdorf that she was guiltless of the plot; she
had been the agent in decoying him to the cabin,
and likely enough, since her work took her among
the various cabin stores, he would attribute to her
the finding and smuggling out of the tin of snuff.
If the plot failed, Doomsdorf would punish her
part with death,—or else with pain and hardship
hardly less than death. If Bess failed to reach his
eyes with the blinding snuff, if Ned’s axe missed its
mark, <span class='it'>she as well as they would be utterly lost</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Doomsdorf was walking swiftly; already he was
halfway from the door. The desperate fight for
freedom was almost at hand. But what was freedom
compared to the fear and darkness that is
death?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ideal sustained her no more. It brought no
fire to her frozen heart. It was an empty word,
nothing that could thrill and move one of her kind
and creed. Its meaning flickered out for her, and
terror, infinite and irresistible, seized her like a
storm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were no depths of ignominy beyond her
now. She cried out shrilly and incoherently, then
stumbling through the snow, caught Doomsdorf’s
arm. “No, no,” she cried, fawning with lips and
hands. “Don’t go in there—they’re going to try
to kill you. I didn’t have anything to do with it—I
swear I didn’t—and don’t make me suffer
when I’ve saved you——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook her roughly, until the torrent of her
words had ceased, and she was silenced beneath his
lurid gaze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You say—they’ve got a trap laid for me?” he
demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her hands clasped before him. “Yes, but I say
I’m not guilty——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pushed her contemptuously from him, and
she fell in the snow. Then, with a half-animal snarl
that revealed all too plainly his murderous rage, he
drew his pistol from his holster and started on.</p>

<div><h1>XXIX</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Watching</span> through the crack in the door Ned
saw the girl’s act; and her treason was immediately
evident to him. Whatever darkness engrossed him
at the sight of the ignoble girl, begging for her little
life even at the cost of her lover’s, showed not at all
in his white, set face. Whatever unspeakable
despair came upon him at this ruin of his ideals,
this destruction of all his hopes, it was evidenced
neither in his actions nor in the clear, cool quality
of his thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No other crisis had ever found him better disciplined.
His mind seemed to circumscribe the
whole, dread situation in an instant. He turned,
met Bess’s straightforward gaze, saw her half-smile
of complete understanding. As she leaped toward
him, he snatched up their two hooded outer coats,
and his arm half encircling her, he guided her
through the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whether or not she realized what had occurred
he did not know, but there was no time to tell her
now. Nor were explanations necessary; trusting
him to the last she would follow where he led.
“We’ll have to run for it,” he whispered simply.
“Fast as you can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned had taken in the situation, made his decision,
seized the parkas, and guided Bess through
the door all in one breath: the drama of Lenore’s
tragic dishonor was still in progress in the glare of
the Northern Lights. Doomsdorf, standing back
to them, did not see the two slip out the door, snatch
up their snowshoes and fly. Otherwise his pistol
would have been quick to halt them. Almost at
once they were concealed, except for their strange
flickering shadows in the snow, behind the first
fringe of stunted spruce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned led her straight toward the ice-bound sea.
He realized at once that their least shadow of hope
lay in fast flight that might take them to some inhabited
island before Doomsdorf could overtake
them; never in giving him a chase across his own
tundras. Even this chance was tragically small,
but it was all they had. To stay, to linger but a
moment, meant death from Doomsdorf’s pistol—or
perhaps from some more ingenious engine that
his half-mad cunning might devise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only the miles of empty ice stretched before
them, covered deep with snow and unworldly in the
glimmer of the Northern Lights that still flickered
wanly in the sky; yet no other path was open.
They halted a single instant in the shelter of the
thickets, slipped on their snowshoes, then mushed
as fast as they could on to the beach. In scarcely a
moment they were venturing out on the ice-bound
wastes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Doomsdorf encountered their tracks as he
reached the cabin door, and guessing their intent,
raced for the higher ground just above the cabin.
But <a id='when'></a>when he caught sight of the fugitives, they
were already out of effective pistol range. He
fired impotently until the hammer clicked down
against an empty breach, and then, still senseless
with fury, darted down to the cabin for his rifle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he halted before he reached the door. After
all, there was no particular hurry. He knew how
many miles of ice—some of it almost impassable—lay
between his island and Tzar Island, far to
the east. It was not the journey for a man and
woman, traveling without supplies. There was no
need of sending his singing lead after them. Cold
and hunger, if he gave them play, would stop them
soon enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had, however, other plans. He turned
through the cabin door, spoke to the sullen squaw,
then began to make preparations for a journey.
He took a cold-proof wolf-hide robe, wrapped in it
a great sack of pemmican, and made it into a convenient
pack for his back. Then he reloaded his
pistol, took the rifle down from the wall, and
started forth down the trail that Ned and Bess had
made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was likely true that the cold, though not
particularly intense to-night, would master them
before ever they could reach Tzar Island. They
had no food, and inner fuel is simply a matter of
life and death while traveling Arctic ice. They
had no guns to procure a fox, or any other living
creatures that they might encounter on the ice
fields. But yet Doomsdorf was not content.
Death of cold was hardly less merciful than that of
a bullet. Just destruction would not satisfy the
fury in his heart; the strange, dark lust that raced
through his veins like poison demanded a more direct
vengeance. Particularly he did not want Bess
to die on the ice. He would simply follow them,
overtake them, and bring them back; then some
really diverting thing would likely occur to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It would be easy to do. There was no man in
the North who could compete with him in a fair
race. The two had less than a mile start of him,
and to overtake them was but a matter of hours.
On the other hand long days of travel, one after
another past all endurance, would be necessary before
they could ever hope to cross the ice ranges to
reach the settlements on Tzar Island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Bess first came the realization of the utter
hopelessness of their flight. She could not blind
herself to this fact. Nor did she try to hide from
herself the truth: in these last, bitter months she
had found that the way of wisdom was to look truth
in the face, struggling against it to the limit of her
strength, but yielding herself neither to vain hope
nor untoward despair. The reason why the flight
was hopeless was because she herself could not
stand the pace. She did not have the beginning of
Ned’s strength. Soon he would have to hold back
so that she could follow with greater ease, and that
meant their remorseless hunter would catch up.
The venture had got down simply to a trial of speed
between Doomsdorf, whose mighty strength gave
him every advantage, and Ned, who braved the ice
with neither blankets nor food supplies. Her presence,
slowing down Ned’s speed, increased the odds
against him beyond the last frontier of hope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tired though she was from the day’s toil, she
moved freshly and easily at first. Ned broke trail,
she mushed a few feet behind. She had no sensation
of cold; hardened to steel, her muscles moved
like the sliding parts of a wonderful machine. The
ice was wonderfully smooth as yet, almost like the
first, thin, bay ice frozen to the depth of safety.
But already the killing pace had begun to tell. She
couldn’t keep it up forever without food and rest.
And the brute behind her was tireless, remorseless
as death itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Northern Lights died at last in the sky, and
the two hastened on in the wan light of a little
moon that was already falling toward the west.
And now she was made aware that the night was
bitter cold. It was getting to her, in spite of her
furs. But as yet she gave no sign of distress to
Ned. A great bravery had come into her heart,
and already she could see the dawn—the first
aurora of ineffable beauty—of her far-off and
glorious purpose. She would not let herself stop
to rest. She would not ask Ned to slacken his pace.
She was tired to the point of anguish already; soon
she would know the last stages of fatigue; but even
then she would not give sign. Out of her love for
him a new strength was born—that sublime and
unnamable strength of women that is nearest to
divinity of anything upon this lowly earth—and
she knew that it would hold her up beyond the last
limits of physical exhaustion. She would not give
way to unconsciousness, thus causing Ned to stop
and wait beside her till she died. None of these
things would she do. Her spirit soared with the
wings of her resolve. Instead, her plan was simply
to hasten on—to keep up the pace—until she
toppled forward lifeless on the ice. She would
master herself until death mastered her. Then
Ned, halting but an instant to learn the truth, could
speed on alone. Thus he would have no cause to
wait for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He travels the fastest who travels alone. Out of
his chivalry he would never leave her so long as a
spark of life remained in her body: her course was
simply to stand the pace until the last spark went
out. She could fight away unconsciousness. She
knew she could; as her physical strength ebbed, she
felt this new, wondrous power sweeping through
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He travels the fastest who travels alone. Without
her, his mighty strength of body and spirit
might carry him to safety. It was a long chance at
best, over the ice mountains; but this man who
mushed before her was not of ordinary mold. The
terrible training camp through which he had passed
had made of him a man of steel, giving him the lungs
of a wolf and a lion’s heart, and it was conceivable
that, after unimagined hardship, he might make
Tzar Island. There he could get together a party
to rescue Lenore, and though his love for the ignoble
girl was dead, his destiny would come out
right after all. It was all she dared pray for now,—that
he might find life and safety. But he was
beaten at the start if he had to wait for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On and on through the night they sped, over that
wonderfully smooth ice, never daring to halt:
strange, wandering figures in the moonlit snow.
But Bess was not to carry her brave intent through
to the end. She had not counted on Ned’s power
of observation. He suddenly halted, turned and
looked into her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was wan and dim in the pale light; and yet
something about its deepening lines quickened his
interest. She saw him start; and with a single
syllable of an oath, reached his hand under her hood
to the track of the artery at her throat. He needed
to listen but an instant to the fevered pulse to know
the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re going too fast,” he told her shortly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—no!” Her tone was desperate, and his
eyes narrowed with suspicion. Wrenching back
her self-control she tried to speak casually. “I can
keep up easily,” she told him. “I don’t feel it yet—I’ll
tell you when I do. We can’t ever make it
if we slow up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook his head, wholly unconvinced. “I
don’t know what’s got into you, Bess. You can’t
fool me. I know I feel it, good and plenty, and
you’re just running yourself to death. Doomsdorf
himself can’t do any more than kill us——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he can——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re going to hit an easier pace. Believe me,
he’s not running his heart out. He’s planning on
endurance, rather than speed. I was a fool not to
think about you until it began to get me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was true that the killing pace had been using
up the vital nervous forces of both their bodies.
Ned was suffering scarcely not at all as yet, but he
had caught the first danger signals. Bess was already
approaching the danger point of fatigue.
When Ned started on again he took a quick but
fairly easy walking pace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet Bess’s only impulse was to give way to tears.
If their first gait had been too fast, this was far
too slow. While it was the absolute maximum that
she could endure—indeed she could not stand it
without regular rests that would ultimately put
them in Doomsdorf’s hands—it was considerably
below Ned’s limit. He could not make it through
at such a pace as this. Because of her, he was destroying
his own chance for life and freedom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They mushed on in silence, not even glancing
back to keep track of Doomsdorf. And it came
about, in the last hours of the night, that the rest
both of them so direly needed was forced upon them
by the powers of nature. The moon set; and generally
smooth though the ice was, they could not
go on by starlight. There was nothing to do but
rest till dawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lie down on the ice,” Ned advised, “and don’t
worry about waking up.” His voice moved her
and thrilled her in the darkness. “I’ll set myself
to wake up at the first ray; that’s one thing I can
always do.” She let her tired body slip down on
the snow, relying only on her warm fur garments
to protect her from it. Ned quickly settled beside
her. “And you’d better lie as close to me as you
can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was prompted only by the expedience of cold.
Yet as she drew near, pressing her body against his,
it was as if some dream that she had dared not admit,
even to herself, had come true. Nothing could
harm her now. The east wind could mock at her in
vain, the starry darkness had no terror for her.
The warmth of his body sped through her, dear
beyond all naming; and such a ghost as but rarely
walks those empty ice fields came and enfolded her
with loving arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the Ghost of Happiness. Of course it
was not real happiness,—only its shadow, only its
dim image built of the unsubstantial stuff of dreams,
yet it was an ineffable glory to her aching heart.
It was just an apparition that was born of her own
vain hopes, yet it was kindly, yielding one hour of
unspeakable loveliness in this night of woe and terror.
Lying breast to breast, she could pretend that
he was hers, to-night. Of course real happiness
could not come to her; the heart that beat so steadily
close to hers was never hers; yet for this little
hour she was one with him, and the ghost seemed
very, very near. She could forget the weary wastes
of ice, the cold northern stars, their ruthless enemy
ever drawing nearer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instinctively Ned’s arms went about her, pressing
her close; and tremulous with this ghost of happiness,
the high-born strength of woman’s love
surged through her again, more compelling than
ever before. Once more her purpose flamed, wan
and dim at first, then slowly brightening until its
ineffable beauty filled her eyes with tears. Once
more she saw a course of action whereby Ned might
have a fighting chance for life. Her first plan, denied
her because of Ned’s refusal to lead faster than
she could follow, had embodied her own unhappy
death from the simple burning up of her life forces
from over-exertion; but this that occurred to her
now was not so merciful. It might easily preclude
a fate that was ten times worse than death. Yet
she was only glad that she had thought of it. She
suddenly lifted her face, trying to pierce the pressing
gloom and behold Ned’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want you to promise me something, Ned,”
she told him quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He answered her clearly, from full wakefulness.
“What is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want you to promise—that if you see there’s
no hope for me—that you’ll go on—without me.
Suppose Doomsdorf almost overtook us—and you
saw that he could seize me—but you could escape—I
want you to promise that you won’t wait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To run off and desert you——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen, Ned. Use your good sense. Say I was
in a place where I couldn’t get away, and you could.
Suppose we became separated somehow on the ice,
and he should be overtaking me, but you’d have a
good chance to go to safety. Oh, you would go on,
wouldn’t you?” Her tone was one of infinite
pleading. “Would there be any use of your returning—and
getting killed yourself—when you
couldn’t possibly save me? Don’t you see the thing
to do would be to keep on—with the hope of coming
out at last—and then getting up an expedition
to rescue me? Promise me you won’t destroy
what little hope we have by doing such a foolish
thing as that——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wondering, mystified by her earnestness, half inclined
to believe that she was at the verge of delirium
from cold and exertion, his arms tightened
about her and he gave her his promise so that she
might rest. “Of course I’ll do the wise thing,” he
told her. “The only thing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her strong little arms responded to the embrace,
and slowly, joyously she drew his face toward hers.
“Then kiss me, Ned,” she told him, soberly yet
happily, as a child might beg a kiss at bedtime.
Her love for him welled in her heart. “I want you
to kiss me good night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly, with all the tenderness of his noble manhood,
he pressed his lips to hers. “Good night,
Bess,” he told her simply. For an instant, night
and cold and danger were forgotten. “Good night,
little girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their lips met again, but now they did not fall
away so that he could speak. There was no need
for words. His arm about her held her lips to his,
and thus they lay, forgetting the wastes of ice about
them, for the moment secure from the cruel forces
that had hounded them so long. The wind swept by
unheard. The fine snow drifted before it, as if it
meant to cover them and never yield them up again.
The dimmer stars faded and vanished into the recesses
of the sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cold’s scourge was impotent now. The hour
was like some dream of childhood: calm, wondrous,
ineffably sweet. The ghost of happiness seemed no
longer just a shadow. For the moment Bess’s
fancy believed it real.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sleep drifted over Ned. Still with her lips on
his, Bess listened till his slow, quiet breathing told
her that he was no longer conscious. She waited
an instant more, her arms trembling as she pressed
him close as she could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I love you, Ned,” she whispered. “Whatever
I do—it’s all for love of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, very softly so as not to waken him, she
slipped out of his embrace and got to her feet. She
started away straight north,—at right angles to
the direction that they had gone before.</p>

<div><h1>XXX</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Ned’s</span> instincts had been trained like the rest of
him, and they watched over him while he slept.
They aroused him from sleep as soon as it was
light enough to pick his way over the rough ice that
lay in front, yet as if in realization of his physical
need of rest, not an instant sooner. He sprang up
to find the dawn, gray over the ice-bound sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the miracle of the morning, even the possibility
that Doomsdorf had made time while he slept
and was now almost upon him did not hold his
thought an instant. His mind could not reach beyond
the tragic fact that he was alone. Bess was
gone, vanished like a spirit that had never been in
the gray dawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moment was one of cruel but wonderful
revelation to Ned. It was as if some unspeakable
blessing had come to one who was blind, but before
ever sight came to him, it was snatched away. As
sleep had fallen over him, he had suddenly been
close to the most profound discovery, the greatest
truth yet of his earthly life; but now only its image
remained. Bess had been in his arms, her lips
against his, but now his arms were empty and his
lips were cold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had gone. Her tracks led straight north
through the snow. The most glorious hour life had
ever given him had faded like a dream. Whence
lay this glory, the source of his wonder as well as
the crushing despair that now was upon him he
might have seen in one more glance; in one moment’s
scrutiny of his soul he might have laid bare
a heart’s secret that had eluded him for all these
past weary weeks. But there was no time for such
now. Bess had gone, and he must follow her. This
was the one truth left in an incredible heaven and
earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her last words swept through his memory.
They gave him the key: his deductions followed
swift and sure by the process of remorseless logic.
In a single moment he knew the dreadful truth:
Bess had not gone on in the expectation of Ned
overtaking her, thus saving a few moments of his
precious time. She had not gone east at all. She
knew the stars as well as he did: she would have
never, except by some secret purpose, turned
north instead of east. He saw the truth all too
plain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say we became separated somehow on the ice,”
she had told him before he slept, “and he should be
overtaking me but you’d have a chance to go on to
safety!” To quiet her, he had given her his promise
to go on and leave her to her fate; and now she
had <span class='it'>purposely separated</span> herself from him. She
had gone to decoy Doomsdorf from his trail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had chosen the direction that would give
Doomsdorf the longest chase and take him farthest
from Ned’s trail. He couldn’t follow them both.
The morning light would show him that his two
fugitives had separated; and she had reasoned
soundly in thinking that their enemy would pursue
her, rather than Ned. His lust for her was too
commanding for him to take any other course.
While he pursued her, Ned would have every
chance to hurry on eastward to the safety of Tzar
Island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had he not promised that if he found he could
not aid her, he would go on alone? Realizing that
she was holding him back, had she not put herself
where it would be impossible for him to give her
further aid. It would only mean capture and death,
certain as the brightening dawn, for him to follow
and attempt to come between her and Doomsdorf.
On the other hand, this was his chance: while their
savage foe ran north in pursuit of Bess, Ned himself
could put a distance between them that could hardly
be overtaken. There was nothing to gain by following
her—her capture at Doomsdorf’s hands
was an ultimate certainty—only his own life to
lose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had reasoned true. Together their flight
was hopeless. Alone, he had a chance. By leading
Doomsdorf from his trail she had increased mightily
that chance. The affair was all one sided. Yet,
not knowing why, he took the side of folly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Never for a moment did he even consider going
on and leaving her to her fate. He could not aid
her, and yet in one moment more he had launched
forth on her trail, faster than he had ever mushed
before. He had no inward battle, no sense of sacrifice.
There was not even a temptation to take the
way of safety. In these last months he had been
lifted far beyond the reach of any such feeble voice
as that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sped as fast as he could along the dim trail
she had made. The dawn, icy-breathed, soon out-distanced
him, permitting him to see Bess’s fleeing
form before he had scarcely begun to overtake her.
She was just a dark shadow at first against the
stretching fields of white; but he never lost sight of
her after that. With the brightening dawn he saw
her ever more distinctly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And in the middle distance, west of both of them,
he saw the huge, dark form of Doomsdorf bearing
down upon her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had guessed right as to Doomsdorf. Catching
sight of her, he had left their double trail to
overtake her. Hoping and believing that Ned had
taken his chance of safety and was fleeing eastward,
she was leading his enemy ever farther and farther
north, away from him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a strong man, this Cornet who had
fought the North, but the bitter, scalding tears shot
into his eyes at the sight of that strange, hopeless
drama on the ice. But not one of them was in self-pity.
They were all for the slight figure of the girl,
trying still to save him, running so hopelessly from
the brute who was even now upon her. To Ned,
the scene had lost its quality of horror. It was only
unspeakably tragic there behind the rising curtains
of the dawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was trying to dodge him now, cutting back
and forth as a mouse might try to dodge the talons
of a cat,—still trying to save a few little seconds
for Ned. She wasn’t aware yet that her trial was
all in vain. In an attempt to hold Doomsdorf off
as long as possible, she had not paused one instant
to assure herself that Ned had gone on east. He
had given her his word; likely she trusted him implicitly.
The man’s heart seemed to swell, ready to
break, in pity for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment later he saw her slip on the ice, and
in dread silence, Doomsdorf’s arms went about her.
Neither of them had apparently observed Ned.
They only became aware of him as his great shout,
half in rage, half in defiance, reached them across
the ice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was really an instinctive cry. Partly the impulse
behind it was to warn Doomsdorf of his presence,
hoping thus to call his attention from Bess
and thus save the girl immediate insult at his hands.
And kneeling upon the girl’s form, like a great bear
upon its living prey, Doomsdorf looked up and saw
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even at the distance that separated them the
startled movement of his head revealed his unutterable
amazement. Doubtless he thought that Ned
was miles to the east by now. The amazement gave
way to boundless triumph as Ned walked calmly
toward him. Then while he held the girl prone
on the ice with his great knee, Doomsdorf’s rifle
made blue lightning in the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned’s response was to throw his arms immediately
into the air in token of complete surrender.
He was thinking coolly, his faculties in perfect control;
and he knew he must not attempt resistance
now. Only death lay that way; at that range
Doomsdorf could shatter him lifeless to the ice with
one shot from the heavy rifle. It wasn’t enough
just to die, thus taking a quick road out of Doomsdorf’s
power. Such a course would not aid Bess.
And to Bess he owed his duty—to aid Bess, in
every way he could, was his last dream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first he had had to play the cruel game for
the sake of Lenore. That obligation was past now;
but it had never, at its greatest, moved him with
one-half the ardor as this he bore to Bess. He must
not go this route to freedom, or any other, until
Bess could go with him. He must not leave her in
Doomsdorf’s power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That much was sure. Self-inflicted death did
not come into the Russian’s calculations—he was
too close to the beasts for that—so he would not
be on guard. Whatever befell, this gate was always
open. Ned would play the game through to
the end, at her side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Doomsdorf watched him approach in silence.
The triumphant gloating that Ned expected did
not come to pass; evidently their brute master was
in too savage a mood even for this. “Wait where
you are,” he ordered simply, “or I’ll blow your
head off. I’ll be ready for you in a minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He bent, and with one motion jerked Bess to her
feet. Then in silence, still guarding them with his
rifle, he pointed them their way,—back to his cabin
on the island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a long and bitter march across that desolate
ice. Except for a share of his pemmican that
Doomsdorf distributed, for expedience rather than
through any impulse of mercy, Bess could have
hardly lasted out. They walked almost in silence,
Ned in front, then Bess, their captor bringing up
the rear; a strange death march over those frozen
seas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was the end. The fight was done; there
was no thought or dream but that the last, fighting
chance was lost. Ned knew he was going to his
death: any other possibility was utterly beyond
hope. The only wonder he had left was what form
his death would take. There was no shadow of
mercy on the evil face of his captor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bess knew that her portion was also death, simply
because the white, pure flame that was her life
could not abide in the body that was prey to
Doomsdorf. Death itself would cheat those terrible,
ravishing hands: this was as certain a conviction
as any she had ever known in all the brief
dream of her life. Whether it would be brought
about by her own hand, by the merciful, caressing
touch of her lover’s knife, or whether simply by
outraged nature, snatching her out of Doomsdorf’s
power, she neither knew nor cared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The file trudged on. Ned led the way unguided.
The hours passed. The dim shadow of the shore
crags strengthened. And another twilight was laying
its first shadows on the snow as they stepped
upon the snowy beach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was at this point that Bess suddenly experienced
an inexplicable quickening of her pulse, an
untraced but breathless excitement that was wholly
apart from the fact that she was nearing the cabin
of her destiny. The air itself seemed curiously
hushed, electric, as if a great storm were gathering;
the moment was poignant with a breathless suspense.
She could not have told why. Warning of
impending, great events had been transmitted to
her through some unguessed under-consciousness;
some way, somehow, she knew that it had reached
her from the mind of the man who walked in front.
Fiery thoughts were leaping through Ned’s brain,
and some way they had passed their flame to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment later Ned turned to her, ostensibly to
help her up the steep slope of the beach. She saw
with amazement that his face was stark white and
that his eyes glowed like live coals. Yet no message
was conveyed to Doomsdorf, tramping behind.
It was only her own closeness to him, her love that
brought her soul to his, that told her of some
far-reaching and terrific crisis that was at hand at
last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Walk exactly in my steps!</span>” he whispered under
his breath. It was only the faintest wisp of
sound, no louder than his own breathing; yet
Bess caught every word. She did not have to be
told that there was infinite urgency behind the command.
Her nerves seemed to leap and twitch; yet
outwardly there was no visible sign that a message
had been passed between them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now Ned was leading up toward the shore crags,
into a little pass between the rocks that was the
natural egress from the beach on to the hills behind.
He walked easily, one step after another in regular
cadence: only his glowing eyes could have told that
this instant had, by light of circumstances beyond
Bess’s ken, become the most crucial in his life. And
it was a strange and ironic thing that the knowledge
he relied on now, the facility that might turn defeat
into victory, was not some finesse gained in his
years of civilized living, no cultural growth from
some great university far to the south, but merely
one of the basic tricks of a humble trade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Doomsdorf had told him, once, that a good trapper
must learn to mark his sets. Any square yard
of territory must be so identified, in the mind’s eye,
that the trapper can return, days later, walk
straight to it and know its every detail. Ned Cornet
had learned his trade. He was a trapper; and
he knew this snowy pass as an artist knows his canvas.
He stepped boldly through.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bess walked just behind, stepping exactly in his
tracks. Her heart raced. It was not merely because
the full truth was hidden from her that she
walked straight and unafraid. She would always
follow bravely where Ned led. Now both of them
had passed through the little, narrow gap between
lofty, snow-swept crags. Doomsdorf trudged just
behind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then something sharp and calamitous as a lightning
bolt seemed to strike the pass. There was a
loud ring and clang of metal, the sharp crack of a
snowshoe frame broken to kindling, and then, obliterating
both, a wild bellow of human agony like
that of a mighty grizzly wounded to the death.
Ned and Bess had passed in safety, but Doomsdorf
had stepped squarely into the great bear trap that
Ned had set the evening before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cruel jaws snapped with a clang of iron and
the crunch of flesh. The shock, more than any human
frame could endure, hurled Doomsdorf to his
knees; yet so mighty was his physical stamina that
he was able to retain his grip on his rifle. And the
instant that he went down Ned turned, leaping with
savage fury to strike out his hated life before he
could rise again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was upon him before Doomsdorf could raise
his rifle. As he sprang he drew his knife from its
sheath, and it cut a white path through the gathering
dusk. And now their arms went about each
other in a final struggle for mastery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caught though he was in the trap, Doomsdorf
was not beaten yet. He met that attack with incredible
power. His great hairy hand caught
Ned’s arm as it descended, and though he could not
hold it, he forced him to drop the blade. With the
other he reached for his enemy’s throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was the final conflict; yet of such might
were these contestants, so terrible the fury of their
onslaughts, that both knew at once that the fight
was one of seconds. These two mighty men gave
all they had. The fingers clutched and closed at
Ned’s throat. The right hand of the latter, from
which the blade had fallen, tugged at the pistol butt
at Doomsdorf’s holster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bess leaped in, like a she-wolf in defense of her
cubs, but one great sweep of Doomsdorf’s arm
hurled her unconscious in the snow. There were to
be no outside forces influencing this battle. The
trap at Doomsdorf’s foot was Ned’s only advantage;
and he had decoyed his enemy into it by his
own cunning. It was man to man at last: a cruel
war settled for good and all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It could endure but an instant more. Already
those iron fingers were crushing out Ned’s life. So
closely matched were the two foes, so terrible their
strength, that their bodies scarcely moved at all;
each held the other in an iron embrace, Ned tugging
with his left hand at the fingers that clutched
his throat, Doomsdorf trying to prevent his foe
from drawing the pistol that he wore at his belt and
turning it against him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the last war; and now it had become
merely a question of which would break first. They
lay together in the snow, utterly silent, motionless,
for all human eyes could see, their faces white with
agony, every muscle exerting its full, terrific pressure.
Ever Doomsdorf’s fingers closed more
tightly at Ned’s throat; ever Ned’s right hand drew
slowly at the pistol at Doomsdorf’s belt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Neither the gun nor the strangling fingers would
be needed in a moment more. The strain itself
would soon shatter and destroy their mortal hearts.
The night seemed to be falling before Ned’s eyes;
his familiar, snowy world was dark with the nearing
shadow of death. But the pistol was free of the
holster now, and he was trying to turn it in his
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It took all the strength of his remaining consciousness
to exert a last, vital ounce of pressure.
Then there was a curious low sound, muffled and
dull as sounds heard in a dream. And dreams
passed over him, like waves over water, as he relaxed
at last, breathing in great sobs, in the reddened
drifts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bess, emerging into consciousness, crawled
slowly toward him. He felt the blessing of her
nearing presence even in his half-sleep. But
Doomsdorf, their late master, lay curiously inert,
his foot still held by the cruel jaws of iron. A
great beast-of-prey had fallen in the trap; and the
killer-gun had sped a bullet, ranging upward and
shattering his wild heart.</p>

<hr class='tbk103'/>

<p class='pindent'>All this was just a page in Hell Island’s history.
She had had one dynasty a thousand-thousand
years before ever Doomsdorf made his first track
in her spotless snows; and all that had been done
and endured was not more than a ripple in the
tides that beat upon her shores. With a new spring
she came into her own again. Spring brought the
<span class='it'>Intrepid</span>, sputtering through the new passages between
the floes; and the old island kings returned
to rule before ever the masts of the little craft had
faded and vanished in the haze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Intrepid</span> had taken cargo other than the
usual bales of furs. The sounds of human voices
were no more to be heard in the silences, and the
wolf was no longer startled, fear and wonder at
his heart, by the sight of a tall living form on the
game trails. The traps were moss-covered and
lost, and the wind might rage the night through at
the cabin window, and no one would hear and no
one would be afraid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The savage powers of the wild held undisputed
sway once more, not again to be set at naught by
these self-knowing mortals with a law unto themselves.
Henceforth all law was that of the wild,
never to be questioned or disobeyed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It may have been that sometimes, on winter
nights, the wolf pack would meet a strange, great
shadow on the snow fields: but if so, it was only the
one-time master of the island, uneasy in his cold
bed; and it was nothing they need fear or to turn
them from the trail. It was just a shadow that
hurried by, a wan figure buffeted by the wind, in
the eerie flare of the Northern Lights. And even
this would pass in time. He would be content to
sleep, and let the snow drift deeper over his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even the squaw had gone on the <span class='it'>Intrepid</span> to join
her people in a distant tribe. But there is no need
to follow her, or the three that had taken ship with
her. On the headlong journey south to spread the
word of their rescue, of their halting at the first port
to send word and to learn that the occupants of the
second lifeboat had been rescued from Tzar Island
months before, of Godfrey Cornet’s glory at the
sight of his son’s face and the knowledge of the
choice he had made, of the light and shadow of
their life trails in the cities of men, there is nothing
that need be further scrutinized. To Hell Island
they were forgotten. The windy snow fields knew
them no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet for all they were bitterly cruel, the wilds had
been kind too. They had shown the gold from the
dross. They had revealed to Ned the way of happiness,—and
it led him straight into Bess’s arms.
There he could rest at the end of his day’s toil, there
he found not only love and life, but the sustenance
of his spirit, the soul of strength by which he might
stand erect and face the light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus they had found a safe harbor where the
Arctic wind might never chill them; a hearth where
such terror as dwelt in the dark outside could not
come in.</p>

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your

or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
